The Commission published in November 2006 an evaluation of the Less Favoured Area measure in the 25 Member States of the EU. The results indicate that the LFA measure has been part of a set of policies which have proved successful in maintaining farming but with variable results at the more specific land management level. The focus on livestock farms has helped to address the key issue of continued grazing on farms where profitability tends to be low and this is a major contribution to meeting nature conservation and landscape goals over a significant area. Other habitat types have benefited less from the LFA measure. The results of this study are used as an input in the discussions on the revision of the LFA scheme. Following the inclusion into axis 2 of the renewed rural development policy, natural handicap payments now have a stronger focus on land management, contributing, through continued use of agricultural land, to maintaining the countryside and to maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems that deliver public goods, such as valuable landscapes, biodiversity, soil conservation and fire prevention in areas where farming is difficult.

After a 2 year review process, the Commission adopted on 21 December 2007 a package to improve the EU policy on industrial emissions. This includes a Proposal for a Directive on industrial emissions [COM(2007) 843 final] [SEC(2007) 1679] [SEC(2007) 1682] that recasts seven existing Directives related to industrial emissions into a single clear and coherent legislative instrument. The recast includes the IPPC Directive, the Large Combustion Plants Directive, the Waste Incineration Directive, the Solvents Emissions Directive and 3 Directives on Titanium Dioxide. (see http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pollutants/stationary/ippc/proposal.htm). The IPPC Directive (2008/1/EC) requires installations falling under its scope to operate in accordance with permits including emission limit values based on the best available techniques (BAT), designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and the impact to the environment as a whole. The prevention or reduction of emissions to air, water and soil should therefore be dealt with in the environmental permits issued in accordance with the IPPC Directive. The key deadline for the full implementation of the Directive was 30/10/2007. \n\nEPER is the European Pollutant Emission Register, the first European-wide register of industrial emissions into air and water, which was established by a Commission Decision of 17 July 2000. According to the EPER Decision, Member States have to produce a triennial report, which covers the emissions of 50 pollutants to be included if the threshold values indicated in Annex A1 of the EPER Decision are exceeded. Reports (2001, 2004) are published on the internet (http://eper.ec.europa.eu). From 2007 reporting will be made according to Regulation 2006/166/EC concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers that replaces EPER. \n\nThe aim of the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC) is to prevent or to reduce as far as possible negative effects on the environment caused by the incineration and co-incineration of waste. The WI Directive requires the Commission to report on the application of the Directive, in particular for new plants and on the progress achieved in emission control techniques and experience in waste management. The Commission\'s Communication \'Towards on improved policy on industrial emissions\' summarises this report. The 4th Implementation Report on Urban Waste Water Directive (91/271/EEC) was published on 22 March 2007 linked to the Communication “Towards Sustainable Water Management in the European Union”.

The CSP for Pakistan mentions water and forest management activities within its focal area ‘Rural development and natural resource management’ that receives 54% of the total country allocation. Additionally, the CSPs of Bangladesh, India, China and Bhutan have environment as a focal sector, thus biodiversity is not specifically targeted. The RSP for Central Asia and in particular its focal sector on environment promotes the management and governance of water and forests. \n\nIn Latin America, the CSPs of Brazil, Honduras and Bolivia address biodiversity, the latter two country programmes having natural resources management as a focal area. For Brazil, the focal sector in question targets the promotion of the environmental dimension of sustainable development, and foresees among its priority objectives the curbing of deforestation, the prevention of biodiversity loss and the improvement of governance in natural resource utilization. For Bolivia, the focal sector on sustainable water management targets inter alia to improve conservation and preservation of water and to increase the government capacity for the integrated management of water resources. The foreseen allocation in Latin America would be around € 115 millions within National Indicative Programmes. \n\nFor ACP countries, programming is in its final phases and all CSPs still need final official adoption. However, general trends can be drawn from the process and show that biodiversity is very rarely selected as a priority sector (these need to be limited to 2 only). Globally, an increase is foreseen with €34 millions per year on average for 2007-2010 compared to €24 millions during the 2002-2006 period (However, the annual EDF allocation has been approximately doubled between the two periods). \n\nThe African CSP is the one for which biodiversity appears in most cases in non-focal sectors.

Central African region, Malawi and Ethiopia are the countries where CSPs/RSPs present the highest focus on biodiversity.
