Action plans are being prepared for mammals:  Lutra lutra ; amphibians : Epidalea calamita; reptiles: Vipera berus and invertebrates : Euphydryas aurinia, Lycanea helle and Lycanea dispar.Population trends of common bird species are computerized in Wallonia since 1990. The method consists of \"listening points\" of five minutes to repeat from year to year in similar conditions of time and weather. It is easy to apply and it combines a relatively high informal input with methodical observation. Indices are given for 79 species with some basic statistics, test results for regional or habitats variations and a short comment on the quality of observation. The final discussion also tackles the question of data quality and representativeness.Brussels Capital Region (BHG): Since 1992, 49 bird common species are monitored in the Brussels Capital Region by the help of listening points.

The SISD is part of the German Biodiversity Strategy and of the National Sustainability Strategy. The SISD is a highly aggregated state indicator for the quality of nature and the landscape in Germany. To calculate the indicator, population trends of 59 selected bird species are monitored that represent the main landscape and habitat types and land use practices in Germany. This allows for conclusions about the state of the ‘normal’ landscape. Population sizes of the selected bird species directly reflect the sustainability of the landscape as a habitat for these species. As not only birds but many other species rely on a richly structured landscape with intact, sustainably managed habitats, the indicator also provides an indirect insight into the development of species diversity and the sustainability of current land use practices.','Reference or title:Weblink:References concerning national ‘Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity’ (SISD):1) Achtziger, R., Stickroth, H. & Zieschank, R.

Habitat specialist indicators (French Research Centre on Bird Population Biology - CRBPO)4 multi-species indicators are produced each year aggregating abundance indices of species depending on their specialisation to a given habitat. 4 species groups are defined, including 65 species: specialists of forests (18 species), farmlands (20), human settlement (13) and generalists (14) .The degree of specialisation of each species is calculated via the distribution of the species among the three types of habitat (French breeding bird survey, STOC) compared to their availability. When a species is more present in an habitat than expected if its distribution were homogeneous, it is considered as a specialist of this habitat. When a species does not show any bias in its distribution, it is considered as a generalist. The results show that specialist species decline more than average, whereas generalist species tend to spread.b. Indicator of climate change impact (French Research Centre on Bird Population Biology - CRBPO)This indicator estimates the impact of climate change on common breeding bird species, using data from the French breeding bird survey (STOC). It is calculated using the concept of “thermal maximum”. The thermal maximum in Europe for a species is the maximal temperature at which a species breeds in Europe. Its value is estimated using the average temperature between March and August in all the squares of the European breeding bird atlas (Hagemeijer & Blair, 1997). It is defined as the 5% atlas cases of the species where the average temperature is the highest. The average growth rate of the group of 15 species with the lower “thermal maximum” (most vulnerable to climate change) is compared to the average growth rate of the group of 15 species with the higher “thermal maximum” (least vulnerable to climate change). The difference between the two trends gives an estimation of global warming impact on common breeding bird species. Since 1989, this difference has grown by 1.86% approximately each year.A similar indicator has been developed at a European level with the contribution of the French bird monitoring team (STOC program) (Gregory et al, 2009).2. Indicators based on community traits The methods described below are applicable to any taxa with large-scale survey data, using either abundance or occurrence data. a. Community Specialisation Index (French Research Centre on Bird Population Biology - CRBPO)Functional homogenisation of a community can be estimated as the average specialisation of the species present in that community (Julliard et al, 2006). Species habitat specialisation is quantified with the species specialisation index (SSI), defined as the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/ mean) of the species density across habitats Then, the community specialisation index (CSI) is calculated as the average specific specialisation index of all individuals detected in a given plot. Using data from the French breeding bird survey, Devictor et al (2007) showed that CSI is very sensitive to landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance, which are two measures of environmental degradation.b. Community Temperature Index (French Research Centre on Bird Population Biology - CRBPO)Change in community composition in response to climate warming can be estimated via a framework based on a community temperature index (CTI) that directly reflects, for a given species assemblage, the balance between low- and high-temperature dwelling species. First, for a given species, one can estimate the long term average temperature experienced by individuals of that species over its range (species temperature index, STI).  Then, any local species assemblage can be characterised by a community temperature index (CTI) calculated as the average of each individual’s STI present in the assemblage. High CTI would thus reflect a large proportion of species with high STI, i.e. of more high-temperature dwelling species. The CTI can then be used to measure local changes in species composition. Using data from the French breeding bird survey, Devictor et al (2008) found a strong increase in CTI over the last two decades revealing that birds are rapidly tracking climate warming, but that change in community composition is insufficient to keep up with temperature increase: birds are lagging approximately 182 km behind climate warming (91 km northward shift in bird community composition compared to 273 km northward shift in temperature).','Reference or title:Weblink:1.a.

	('Y','Y','According to reporting by the Member State, national guidelines have been developed, which specifically take biodiversity concerns with regard to afforestation into account.In Flanders, the use of exotic tree species is prohibited in sensitive/fragile areas (eg, the Flemish Ecological Network VEN as well as nature and forest reserves), unless the decision to afforest with non-native tree species is foreseen in an approved management plan. In certain sensitive areas it is prohibited to change the actual vegetation by means of afforestation. Exemptions can be given by the Agency for Nature and Forests.In the Walloon region, the new Forestry Code entered in force at the end of 2008. The aim of the new code is to safeguard the regeneration and sustainable use of forests, as well as guarantee an optimum and dynamic balance between its economic, ecological and social roles. Certain objectives are imposed on both public and private land owners (eg, choice of species appropriate to local conditions, diversification, measures favouring biodiversity, restricting clear cutting, drainage and input, reasonable opening up to the public, etc.). Article 40 of the new forestry code prohibits artificial regeneration of plots greater than 50 ha contiguous with species that are not in optimal conditions or tolerated as defined in the “ecological species file” approved by the Walloon government. In addition, Article 452/31 of the ‘Code Walloon de l\'aménagement du territoire, de l\'urbanisme et du patrimoine’ (CWATUP) refers to afforestation. Afforestation is only permitted for a period which exceeds twelve years on a property or part of a property non-covered with trees before, and activities of intensive cultivation of tree species for a period which not exceeds twelve years. In addition, the project must meet several conditions: requiring no modification of the relief nor soil drainage; being adjacent to a forest area unless the area to be afforested is greater than three hectare; covering an area of 0.5 ha minimum; used tree species meeting the criteria of the “ecological species file”; and plantations must be at least 10% hardwood species.','According to reporting by the Member State, national guidelines have been developed, which specifically take biodiversity concerns with regard to deforestation into account.In Flanders a specific legislation is in place concerning deforestation. In sensitive areas, deforestation is in principle prohibited and can only be allowed after a specific exemption given by the minister responsible for environment and nature, and subsequently a specific license must be obtained from the responsible authority for building and urban development. In addition, the deforestation must be compensated. For the judgement concerning the licensing of the deforestation, as well as for the approval of the forest compensation, biodiversity and landscape concerns are taken into account in the guidelines. In the Walloon region, in 2006 a new ‘Plan de progrès pour la gestion forestière wallonne’ (2007-2011) was drawn up by a task group that included all stakeholders. It contains 11 objectives organised into 27 actions. Out of its 11 objectives, the 8th one is refers to the enhancement of biodiversity considerations in forests management practices. Objective 7 asks to identify conservation objectives for all forests ecosystems. Objective 5 is on the monitoring of forest health and its improvement, particularly with regards to climate change. Objective 4 is on the equilibrium between games species and the forest ecosystems.','Y',' 20ha*10ha** ','Y','20ha*3ha**','Y',NULL,'Y','3ha**','Y','20ha*','Y','20ha*','N','N','N','N','BE'),

According to the Forestry Act concerning afforestation, new forest must be planted or naturally generated after felling when the land’s capacity to produce timber is not fully exploited. Planting or measures for natural regeneration must have been completed by the end of the third year after felling.The Swedish Forestry Act, Section 7, and associated ordinances, regulate the use of e.g. non-native species: \"Where required for silvicultural reasons, the Government, or public authority designated by the Government, may issue regulations prohibiting, or conditions regulating (i) the use of forest reproductive material of indigenous or foreign origin, in establishing new forest stands; and (ii) trading with such material. The Government, or public authority designated by the Government, may also issue regulations in order to promote, assure and verify authenticity and quality with respect to production and trade with forest reproductive material. Forest reproductive material refers to seeds, seedlings, transplants, and other forms of regenerative material intended to be used for the establishment of new forest stands.\"','According to reporting by the Member State, national guidelines have been developed, which specifically take biodiversity concerns with regard to deforestation into account. According to the Forestry Act concerning deforestation, regeneration felling must not be carried out until the forest has reached a certain age. For predominantly coniferous forests, the age varies between 45 and 100 years. Thinning must encourage forest development. Timber stocks after thinning must be large enough to utilize the production capacity of the land. After thinning the trees must be evenly distributed on the area. Damage to trees and the ground must be avoided as far as possible. Despite any measure undertaken, biological diversity in the forests must always be preserved. At the same time, the cultural heritage must be safeguarded and social aspects must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is important that due care and attention is paid to all forestry measures.Permanent or very long term loss of forest cover only occurs as a result of urban settlements, infrastructure (such as roads, railways etc) and industrial activities. In those cases legal provisions apply to control and mitigate impacts.The Swedish Forestry Act, Section 30, and associated ordinances, regulate environmental consideration in forestry:\"The Government, or public authority designated by the Government, may issue regulations on the degree of respect to be extended to nature conservation and cultural heritage preservation interests in connection with forest management, as regards the form and size of felling areas, regeneration methods, the retention of individual trees and groups of trees, fertilisation, drainage, and the routing of forest roads.To satisfy these interests, the Government, or public authority designated by the Government, may issue regulations prohibiting felling and other forestry measures on forest wasteland. The Government, or public authority designated by the Government may also issue regulations regarding measures to be taken in the event of non-compliance with regulations referred to in the first paragraph. The powers granted in paragraphs one and three of this section do not permit the issuing of regulations, which are so extensive as to severely handicap current land-use.\"','N','','N','','Y',NULL,'Y','','N','','N','','N','','Y','0.5','SE'),

The Irish Sea Cod fishery features the use of separator panels, Swedish grid inserts, square mesh panels etc all of which are designed to facilitate reduction in by-catch particularly of juveniles. The SFPA engages with the Naval Service to inspect vessels declaring use of these gears both in port (prior to and on return from fishing trips) and at sea. Specific monitoring programmes and defined action plans are undertaken with other Member States under the auspices of the CFCA Joint Deployment programmes inspecting specifically for the correct fitting and deployment of these particular gears in this fishery.By-Catch Limits - The catch composition limits for gears and geographic areas (EU Council Reg 850/98) remains in force and directs the bycatch limits of any targeted fishery specific to its area and gears in use. Again the SFPA and Naval Service combined inspection efforts – at sea and on shore landings – to quantify catches onboard and validate the catches made against these specific regulatory requirements. In 2009, 7 case file or prosecutions were initiated with the DPP’s office against vessels breaching the bycatch regulatory requirements. For those landings that are not physically inspected, the IFIS system is used into which all fisheries landing and catch data is entered from logsheet and sales records. This is designed to highlight to the Sea Fisheries Protection Officer when catch and landing data from any vessel on any particular trip exceeds the directed bycatch percentages. Any vessel found in breach of designated limits would then be assigned as an inspection target based on a risk assessment.Education -  The SFPA and BIM have cooperated in the production of a user friendly guide for fishermen on the use of the EU logbook. Inherent in this document is specific detail and guidance on the by-catch limits that are in force under EU Regulations.  In this way fishermen have been encouraged to engage with SFPA inspectors and seek to grow their own knowledge of this technical area.By Catches of other fish - The SFPA and NS again – particularly during the summer Tuna fishery – implement the regulatory requirements surrounding the fitting and use of specific deck gears to avoid seabird by-catch. Other collaborative efforts have also been undertaken and are ongoing with IWDG and with NPWS on a cetacean strategy to avoid by-catch without the use of active sonic transmitters. Benthos - The acknowledgement of VME’s (Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems ) and the establishment of areas where bottom trawling is prohibited to protect the benthos  (Hecate Seamount, Altair Seamount, NW Porcupine etc) has been actively monitored and protected by the Naval Service using VMS alerts and investigation of suspect vessels. This is backed up by FMC sea inspection and detentions.In terms of the maintenance of benthos in other fisheries, SFPA would like to interact with Fishermen’s organisations and representative bodies on specific gears e.g. trawl door paravanes which lift gears from the sea bed and prevent gouging.

Cetacean by-catch: There are a wide range of laws and regulations which prohibit the harassment, abuse and killing of porpoises, dolphins and whales. Cetaceans are protected under the Bern, Bonn (ASCOBANS), and Biological Diversity Conventions, and the Habitat and Species Directive (92/43/EEC). In the UK, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, the Conservation Regulations, and the Countryside and the Rights of Way Act. The UK has a comprehensive by-catch monitoring scheme which gives us a better understanding of those fisheries that are having a negative impact on cetaceans.  The UK submits annual (retrospective) reports to the European Commission on observed by-catch levels in various UK fisheries, as required by Council Regulation 812/2004. Annual reports are available from: http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/fisheries/marine/conservation/cetaceans.htm The UK is committed to avoiding the bycatch of cetaceans wherever possible; and have spent over two million pounds to date since the year 2000 on a range of measures to better understand and reduce the incidental by catch of cetaceans. The purpose of this research is to identify those fisheries responsible for high levels of cetacean by-catch and test mitigation measures that are effective at deterring cetaceans over the long-term and are safe and cost-effective for the industry. This research is undertaken by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU).  As part of this research SMRU are testing, on behalf of Defra, a new acoustic deterrent device to address previous pinger problems identified by the fishing industry. We are committed to finding an acoustic deterrent that is both safe for fishermen to use and effective at deterring cetaceans from fishing gear. The EU Commission is fully aware and supportive of the research as well as the deployment difficulties with the existing pingers. Seabird by-catch: For UK vessels mitigation measures are in place to prevent the by catch of seabirds by long line vessels fishing in certain areas of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. UK is working within the Management organisations responsible for these oceans to strengthen the measures both in terms of the mitigation devices that should be used and to broaden the sea areas to which they are applicable.Sharks & Ray by-catch: The UK fully supports the aims of the EC Shark Plan of Action.  We have undertaken the following measures that will help us meet the aims and objectives laid out in the plan :1) Monitoring:  Commercial landings information (to species-level where possible) is collected by the MFA (soon to become the Marine Management Organisation (MMO)), and this organisation also assists with the enforcement of EC regulations, including the non-retention policy for various threatened elasmobranch species. 2) Special fishing permits (Finning) ;The UK has taken the decision to cease issuing special fishing permits issued under Council Regulation 1185/2003 - which means that UK registered vessels will now have to land sharks with their fins naturally attached. The UK has also written to the European Commission to press for a full review of council regulation 1185/2003 to ensure all sharks caught in European waters are landed with their fins attached.The UK\'s decision to stop issuing permits will rule out any possibility of  carcasses being disposed of at sea and fins retained; will send the strongest possible conservation message to countries where controls are less stringent; and enable the UK to lead the proposed review of the Regulation 1185/2003 at a European level. It will also bring easier enforcement of catches (Finned shark species can be difficult to differentiate), which has the added benefit of increased scientific data on catch compositions, that can be used to aid the determination of the state of stocks and therefore further conservation and management measures. As required under Regulation 1185/2003 - the UK submits annual reports in relation to special fishing permits issued to UK vessels.   These are available from: http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/fisheries/marine/conservation/fstock/sharks.htm 3) Domestic Legislation: The Wildlife and Countryside Act  (1981) consolidates a range of conservation commitments in England and Wales, including the Bern Convention and the EC Habitats Directive.The UK government has given two species of elasmobranch, basking shark (1998) and angel shark (2008), full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Listing of a species under the Act makes it an offence (subject to exceptions) to intentionally kill, injure, take, possess, or trade in that animal.4) Research: Defra, along with a range of other partners has provided the Shark Trust with funding to help develop ID guides to help fishermen fulfil the EU obligations to record landed skates and rays on a species specific basis. We hope that now these accurate guides have been distributed widely by the Governments Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) high quality, species specific data will be collected that will contribute to the possibility of species specific EU quotas being set for these species in the future.Defra has supported various research projects for elasmobranchs, including the Fishery Science Partnership and more recently with projects to examine the discard survival for skates and rays and to examine the movements of spurdog and porbeagle shark. Further research will be undertaken on spurdog and porbeagle to assess the vulnerability of these species, their life history and movements. This will help identify technical measures that could help to minimise bycatch mortality. Such research on skate and rays will provide evidence to assess the discard survivorship of selected skate species, and evaluate the extent to which existing management measures will benefit stocks of concern. In tandem with the additional  data being collected in the form of species specific landings this work will help ICES, the EU and the UK set appropriate, species specific management measures.5) Fisheries management and conservation measures: At the EU and international level the UK has and will continue to work towards the objective of restoring stocks of depleted elasmobranchs and ensuring those faring better are harvested sustainably. Related activities include: a) In recognition of the migratory nature of many elasmobranch species a key aspect of the EC Shark Plan of Action is the Commission and Community’s commitment to work through and with Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.  We are strongly supportive of this and will continue to support the Commission in seeking effective management of shark stocks by RFMOs. b) Setting appropriate TACs for elasmobranchs is an essential part of their management and we support the direction that the EU Commission is taking on this in setting quotas in line with ICES advice.  However, additional and more bespoke measures are likely to be needed to effectively manage these stocks and to ensure those that are caught in non-directed fisheries can be safely returned alive. c) Supporting listing of sharks species on CITES where there is the appropriate scientific justification.A UK-wide report is currently in preparation for publication in July 2010 which will include a section on the current status of benthic habitats as assessed by a combination of the available evidence and expert judgement.  The UK Government will publish a response to the report which will detail any planned courses of action to address the problems highlighted, and may result in adaptation of current measures and/or additional management measures being put in place.','UK');

The domestic source of NFOŚiGW’s funding are fees for economic use of environment and penalties for breaching environmental law as well as fees pursuant to the act on recycling of disused vehicles. The NFOŚiGW takes particular care of nature protection and survival of the most endangered species of animals and plants as well as building the public ecological awareness. Nature and landscape protection and support given to forestry are its priorities. Although nature, landscape and forests protection, on the average, has made up 3% of NFOŚiGW’s total spending on protection of environment and water management recently, the impact upon the fields has been still significant. Between 1989 and 2007, over 1000 contracts regarding “landscape and nature protection” were concluded and the subsidies amounted to over 257 million PLN.Adopted in August 2008, the Strategy of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, formulating goals for nature protection in years 2009-2012, specifies that the cofinancing will cover active conservation of nature protection in protected areas in Poland aimed at limiting natural environment degradation and losses of biological diversity resources according to the National Strategy for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity and National Forest Policy. Initiatives that will be legible to the support include actions for conservation of endangered species and genetic diversity of plants, animals, and fungi as well as restoring diversity in ecological corridors for ensuring proper operation of Natura 2000 network. Furthermore, the document emphasized that proper realization of conservation goals in such protected areas as nature reserves, national parks, landscape parks and Natura 2000 sites requires supporting the process of developing management plans and plans for protection of selected species or natural habitats. It is also necessary to restore proper conservation status of natural habitats in ecosystems and shelters of species, especially in Natura 2000 sites.The EcoFund Foundation has actively operated since 1992.

The development of Malta’s NBSAP is still an ongoing process. Although an NBSAP is not yet in place, in the past years national documents of a strategic nature have been developed. These include for instance State of the Environment Reports (SOERs), State of the Environment Indicators (SOEIs), the Structure Plan for the Maltese Islands, the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) and the National Report on the Strategic Action Plan for the Conservation of Maltese Coastal and Marine Biodiversity (SAPBIO Report). These documents have put forward a number of recommendations for safeguarding, as well as for conserving and managing, biological resources in the Maltese Islands. In this respect these documents have served a similar purpose as the NBSAP, that is, that of recommending activities for mainstreaming biodiversity across sectors.

The CSP for Pakistan mentions water and forest management activities within its focal area ‘Rural development and natural resource management’ that receives 54% of the total country allocation. Additionally, the CSPs of Bangladesh, India, China and Bhutan have environment as a focal sector, thus biodiversity is not specifically targeted. The RSP for Central Asia and in particular its focal sector on environment promotes the management and governance of water and forests. \n\nIn Latin America, the CSPs of Brazil, Honduras and Bolivia address biodiversity, the latter two country programmes having natural resources management as a focal area. For Brazil, the focal sector in question targets the promotion of the environmental dimension of sustainable development, and foresees among its priority objectives the curbing of deforestation, the prevention of biodiversity loss and the improvement of governance in natural resource utilization. For Bolivia, the focal sector on sustainable water management targets inter alia to improve conservation and preservation of water and to increase the government capacity for the integrated management of water resources. The foreseen allocation in Latin America would be around € 115 millions within National Indicative Programmes. \n\nFor ACP countries, programming is in its final phases and all CSPs still need final official adoption.

Globally, an increase is foreseen with €34 millions per year on average for 2007-2010 compared to €24 millions during the 2002-2006 period (However, the annual EDF allocation has been approximately doubled between the two periods). \n\nThe African CSP is the one for which biodiversity appears in most cases in non-focal sectors.

For the period 2000-2050, the annual loss of world-wide terrestrial ecosystem services is estimated at around €50 billion.

The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries. In addition, the average national nitrate concentration in one country may be strongly influenced by another country or countries upstream.

FL: An important part of the Flemish Natural Structure, the Integral Interweaving and Supporting Network, is meant to ensure connectivity across the landscape to support and enhance connectivity between the sites of the Flemish Ecological Network (VEN) that comprises the core nature areas with a higher protection status. Only 2 %of the proposed 150,000 ha Interweaving area is designated till now, and ca 89.000 ha of the core sites under VEN out of the targeted 125.000 ha. To strengthen coherence and connectivity in the development of the Flemish Ecological Network Structure (see above) the areas with important natural value or with potential value have been mapped and about 433 connective zones or nature corridors identified – to be consulted on the website www.natuurindicatoren.be under the indicator ‘corridor areas’. Provincial authorities are developing designation and management plans for the corridor areas – 17 pilot projects are now in process. Other instruments to strengthen nature values that enhance ecological connectivity include: establishment of nature reserves, public and private forests, protection of river banks, management of road verges, hedges and other small landscape elements being protected by law, establishment of parks and green areas in and around urban areas,… all being important as stepping stones and corridors. The construction of “eco-tunnels” and “eco-passages” in fragmented habitats and now also as mitigating and compensatory action in various construction projects support connectivity. A project for the construction of two eco-passages in the most important natural site of Brussels, the Sonian Forest, is under study. In the Flemish Region 15% of 193 known barriers for amphibian passages are neutralized till now, while two large ecoduct-projects and 17 ecotunnel-projects have been implemented. De-fragmentation of rivers (cfr BENELUX agreement): Inventories of the obstacles for fish migration have been compiled and measures for restoring migration passages are included in the river basis management plans. In the Flemish Region 116 of 796 (15 %) of known barriers are neutralized till now.       Walloon region : The general concept of the ecological network has been transposed in the ‘Main Ecological Structure’ (Structure écologique principale or SEP) and has been mapped. This structure contains two types of areas: 1) Core areas: the Nature department of the Walloon Region continues to strictly protect natural sites through the following status: government nature reserve (Réserves Naturelles domaniales (RND)), chartered nature reserve (Réserves Naturelles agréees (RNA)), forest reserve (Réserves Forestières (RF)), wetlands of biological interest (Zones Humides d’Interêt Biologique (ZHIB)), and underground cavity of scientific interest (Cavités Souterraines d’Interêt Scientifique (CSIS )), in order to protect important sites for species and habitats. The target of this process is to protect all sites of great biological value on the Walloon territory. 2) ecological development areas: areas where human activities are less intensive in order to obtain a balance between nature conservation and economic incomes. Furthermore the “Code wallon de l´Aménagement du territoire, de l´Urbanisme et du Patrimoine” (CWATUP) provides the possibility to include the \"ecological connection perimeters \" as an additional layer to the “plan de secteur” (art. 40, 2 of CWATUP): \"ecological connection perimeter aims to ensure transition area’s to animal and plant species between their biotopes. Actions and works subjects to work permits may be either prohibited or subject to special protection conditions.      BHG: The Green Network Programme of the Brussels Capital Region intends to gradually build a network of green spaces (parks, woods, forests and gardens) linked together by green corridors (green avenues, road and railway embankments, etc). The programme emphasises the cohesion and continuity of green spaces and semi-natural areas in the urban environment. Its purpose is to integrate the scenic, aesthetic, social, recreational and ecological functions of green spaces and develop their interconnectivity. One of the prime objectives of the Green Network Programme is to increase biodiversity. New green areas are intended to be created (mostly in the very centre of the town), green walls, green roofs and other greenery of buildings and public spaces are promoted. The Blue Network Programme aims to have an integrated, durable and ecologically justified management of open waterways in Brussels. The \"blue network\" is made up of small rivers, ponds and marshes.

According to reporting by the Member State, extensive agricultural land use in the past has shaped a variety of the Flemish region’s characteristic, rare or European important habitats for plants and animals. Intensification and specialisation of agricultural practices have lead to habitat loss in agricultural landscapes and to the abandoning of agricultural land. In 2006, Flemish farmland (675 757 ha of registered parcels) contained 3 200 ha (0.47 %) of biologically very valuable parcels, 12 000 ha (1.8 %) comprising a mix of biologically very valuable and valuable parcels and 34 300 ha (5.1 %) of biologically valuable parcels. This farmland with high nature value is highly fragmented and spread out all over Flanders, with locally high densities in the coastal polders and in the IJzer valley. The area of biologically very valuable parcels mainly consists of small landscape elements such as hedges, ponds and tree rows (30 %), grasslands (30 %) and forests (26 %). Together these elements shape a varied, species rich, historically evolved cultural farmland landscape.Based on a different methodology (Corine geodataset), in 2006 the European Environment Agency identified about 1 % of Belgian agricultural land as high in nature value. Belgium possesses the most nature poor farmland of all EU-15 countries. The fact that only 0.47 % of the Flemish farmland area is biologically very valuable, is consistent with this study.','','High nature value farmland describes the general characteristics of low-input farming systems in terms of biodiversity and management practices, according to Baldock et al. (1993) and Beaufoy et al. (1994).The EEA and JRC report calculated the extent of HNV farmland for each NUTS 2 area in the EU-27.The area of farmed land was calculated as the total land area belonging to the CLC agricultural classes (the 11 ‘agricultural’ classes of Corine level 3 and parts of class 3.2.1 ‘natural grasslands’) plus identified HNV farmland outside these classes.

No information on phosphorus concentrations in lakes was available.','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down. Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially over-aggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Due to this regional competence the legal frameworks and approaches are also different and this is the reason why a differentiated answer is given to the questions above when the regulations are different.Law specifies that ecological networks have to be considered in spatial planning on in FL region, whereas spatial planning procedure in Fl and BHG include an interministerial coordination. Fl:An integral part of the Flemish spatial planning is the demarcation of the Flemish Natural Structure, consisting of the Flemish Ecological Network and the Integral Interweaving and Supporting Network.  Definitions and planning are laid down in the Decree for Nature Conservation (1998) as well as in the Spatial Planning Strategy.The Flemish Ecological Network (VEN) consists of the most important areas for the conservation of nature and biodiversity (core areas). The network is not yet completed, (89,000 out of the target of 125,000 ha) have been designated and integrated in the spatial plans. Next to some general prohibitions described in a specific legal Executive Act, irreparable and irreversible damage to the network is prevented by law. Integral Interweaving and Supporting Network consists of Interweaving Areas and Connecting Areas. This network is meant to ensure connectivity between and buffering of the protected areas in Flanders. Only 2% of the proposed 150,000 ha Interweaving Area (3.059 ha) is designated on the spatial plans until now. As yet, there is no designation of Connecting Area. Although several preparatory studies have been executed, and the spatial maps of provincial authorities identified connecting zones on their territory.Monitoring the effectiveness of the networks by assessing fauna dispersion is not undertaken for the networks as a whole but is assessed locally (for instance to assess the effectiveness of fauna passages within its boundaries.The protection status of the networks has an important place in Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments (SEA).WThe “Code wallon de l´Aménagement du territoire, de l´Urbanisme et du Patrimoine” (CWATUP) provides the possibility to include the \"ecological connection perimeters\" as an additional layer to the “plan de secteur” (art. 40, 2 of CWATUP): \"ecological connection perimeter aims to ensure transition area’s to animal and plant species between their biotopes. Actions and works subjects to work permits may be either prohibited or subject to special protection conditions.  The Authority in charge of granting land planning and environment permission can refuse a request or make the granting of the permit with special conditions for protection. It should at least explain its decision in regards to the future use of the perimeter. Unfortunately there have not been many cases in which Article 40, 2 of the CWATUP was applied. Only a few ecological connection perimeters were listed in plans sector: Wavre-Jogoigne-Perwez ; Liège and Nivelles. In addition, Article 49, 2 of the CWATUP requires that \"sites needed for the ecological network\" must appear in Municipal Development Plans (PCA).BHG: Spatial planning in the Brussels Capital Region is organised by the Brussels code on spatial planning. This code specifies that environmental needs must be taken into account for the elaboration of the Regional Development Plan (art.17). This non restrictive plan establish the Green & Blue Network and is translated into a restrictive Regional Spatial Plan wich include special requirements for the protection of mapped high valued nature areas.

This Decree was a response to the need to take steps to protect inland waters and wildlife and flora associated with them.This necessity arises from the major expansion of recreational activities related to rivers, which, when confined and practiced by a large number of people, inevitably lead to a deterioration of aquatic habitats, flora, both aquatic and riparian and a disturbance of the species, which may particularly affect their reproduction.http://environnement.wallonie.be/legis/eau/eacir006.htmIn June 2008, the Walloon nature and environment federation (Fédération Inter-Environnement Wallonie or IEW) was officially recognised by the Foundation for Environmental Education to issue the eco-label ‘Blue Flag’ to Walloon bathing areas and marinas. ‘Blue Flag’ is an international label that aims to promote the sustainable development of coastal and inland waters by rewarding the environmental efforts of the managers of bathing areas and marinas. It is awarded on a voluntary and annual basis, starting from four major groups of criteria: environmental education and information, environmental management, management of water quality, and security and services. In 2009 the Blue Flag was for the first time awarded to a beach in the Walloon Region, which was also the first region in Blue Flag history to receive the Blue Flag without going through the pilot phase. In the Flemish Region already four beaches and eight marinas have been awarded the label.Just like Blue Flag, the Green Key program is managed on an international level by the Foundation for Environmental Education.

Different aspects of IAS are legislated for at both the Federal and Regional level. At the Federal level, Article 3 of the Arrêté royal portant des mesures relatives à l’importation et au transit de certaines espèces d’oiseaux sauvages non indigènes of 26 October 2001 regulates for the import, export and transit of non-indigenous wild bird species. Under this legislation birds bred in captivity are an exception. The Royal Decree addressing nature conservation and animal welfare (16/07/2009) provides for a list of mammal species that can be kept in captivity for non-commercial purposes. This instrument is also used to regulate the possession of non-native species. Furthermore, Royal Decrees defining quarantine, confinement and eradication actions of pest organisms (as according to the EU legislation, 03/05/1994 and 10/08/2005) can be used to address IAS. In the marine environment, the Royal Decree on the protection of species in the marine waters under Belgian jurisdiction 2001 prohibits the deliberate introduction of IAS into the marine environment. Additionally, the Belgian Law of 20.01.1999 on the protection of the marine environment in marine areas under Belgian jurisdiction prohibits the intentional introduction of non-indigenous species in the marine environment without a licence under Article 11. Article 11 also provides for the eradication of non-indigenous nuisance species under measures taken by Royal Decree and following scientific consultation.As for the forcoming instruments, Royal Decree concerning the import, the exportat and the possession of non-native invasive species (draft version 2/07/2009) is currently being considered for approval. When adopted, this instrument would ban the import, export and possession of a number of identified non-native species that are not yet fully established in Belgium. The list of banned species is to be updated on an annual basis. A great deal of activity in Belgium concerned with IAS is at the level of the three regions. It is prohibited to introduce plants or animals into public forests and forest reserves without a permit under the Forest Decree of the Flemish Region. Furthermore, it is prohibited to introduce alien animal species and there are legal measures to control and eradicate such species in this region. The Decree on Nature Conservation controls or prohibits the transportation of animal species (and their carcasses) in the region. Finally, Executive Act for species conservation (Besluit van de Vlaamse Regering met betrekking tot soortenbescherming en soortenbeheer, 15 May 2009, operative since 1 September 2009) prohibits the intentional release in the wild of non-native species, with exceptions only allowed after a preliminary risk analysis (Note: species used in agriculture and forestry fall outside the scope of this regulation). It also provides a basis for specific actions to be taken to regulate possession, trade and management of non-native species with economic / ecological impacts. In the Walloon Region it is prohibited to introduce non-indigenous species (or indigenous species of non-indigenous origin) with the exception of species used in agriculture and forestry. Furthermore, guidelines have been adopted to to limit the use of invasive plants via public tenders (Circulaire relative aux espèces exotiques envahissantes 23/04/2009). The introduction of non-indigenous bird species into the wild is prohibited in the Brussels Capital Region. Also, Nature Conservation Decree, prohibits the sale, the purchase and the intentional release in the wild of non-native invasive species and provides a legal basis for action plans on non-ntaive species in the capital region (Ordonnance relative a la conservation de la nature/Ordonnantie betreffende het natuurbehoud, draft 2008, not yet published). Finally. Article 14 of the Decision of the Brussels Capital Region concerning the conservation of natural habitats an wild fauna and flora (26 October 2000) provides for the Minister to prevent an introduction of alien species when it has negative impacts on the indigenous fauna and flora.

INBO also communicates the results of its research activities.- to organize and develop Flemish and international reporting about nature and policy evaluation.- to be a data management hub. It looks into appropriate data gathering methods and means by which to disseminate data and make them readily available.- to supply high-quality scientific advice based on scientific facts, data and insights, both proactively and on demand.- to perform research into the diversity of populations, species and ecosystems in order to be able to evaluate area-specific policy measures and optimize them in order to improve the viability of species and ecosystems in the long term.- to perform research into genetic diversity of populations and species in order to evaluate and possibly modify the effectiveness of the area-specific policy measures employed.- to carry out research into the natural environment’s biodiversity potential and the effects of natural or man-made changes upon it (soil, water and air quality, climate).- to perform research to develop expertise on the ecological management of species and ecosystems, ultimately aimed at conserving, restoring or developing biodiversity.- to investigate the sustainable use and management of nature and forest.

The Wallonia region is currently developing its action plan for nature. This is an elaboration of a Nature Plan aiming at a better integration of nature issues in all relevant sectors, and at encouraging exploitation and management methods favourable to wild species. This plan should involve all public and private stakeholders. It will define the general objectives for recovery/restoration of nature/biodiversity and to achieve the goal of stopping the loss of biodiversity in Wallonia. It should be ready by the end of 2013.','','Flemish Region: Environment and Nature Policy Plan 3+ (2007-2010);The Flemish objectives for the conservation of biodiversity are included in the Policy Plan for Environment and Nature (2003-2007, extended to 2010) under a specific chapter ‘Biodiversity’ as well as specific measures under other environment themes. See also http://www.lne.be/themas/beleid/beleidsplanning. The follow-up of the implementation of this policy plan is carried out using CBD-relevant indicators. These can be found at http://www.biodiversityindicators.be. Pages in English are available. Some of the most important operational objectives are given below.- Extension of the area with conservation management. The Flemish Environmental Policy Plan (2003-2010) targeted 50,000 ha with active conservation management by 2007. These areas include the officially recognised nature and forest reserves managed by non-governmental organisations, local authorities or private owners, the nature and forest reserves managed by the Flemish government and the military sites mainly managed for conservation. A method of quantifying the effectiveness of this conservation management is still under development. It is clear that biodiversity within these areas is much higher than outside of them. At the start of the planning period (end 2002) the area with conservation management covered 29,480 ha, or 59% of the target. By the end of 2007, 39,365 ha, or 79% of the target had been reached. Nearly half of the increase was achieved via recognised nature reserves which are managed by non-governmental organisations. If the present trend continues, the target will be achieved by 2013. However, if the decline in funds for nature acquisition continues, there will be a further delay. - Sites designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives. In Flanders, 24 Special Protection Areas have been designated with a total area of 98,423 ha, or 7.3% of the Flemish territory. There were 38 sites designated and put on the list of Sites of Community Interest by the European Commission. The Sites of Community Interest have a total area of 104,888 ha, or 7.8% of the Flemish territory. The total Natura 2000 area comprises 166,187 ha (12.3% of the Flemish terrestrial area). Marine areas are not included, as they are under the jurisdiction of the Belgian federal government. In 2008, there was a limited increase in the Sites of Community Interest, when the main channel of the Sea Scheldt and IJzer were included. An international comparison shows that 12.3% is low in comparison to the European average, but high when compared to neighbouring densely populated regions.- Spatial planning for nature and forest areas. The land destination maps are being actualised to include the designation of the Flemish Ecological Network that supports and enhances Natura 2000, and to extent green destinations for nature and for forest.- Site-specific instruments. These instruments give a framework for conservation measures and for setting up partnerships:      - development of conservation objectives for SCI and SPA sites (Natura 2000)     - site-specific Nature Objectives Plans     - projects for nature development and restoration, especially in Natura 2000 sites     - development and implementation of management plans for nature reserves, forest reserves, parks and green spaces- Species protection. Development and implementation of species protection plans, measures for restoration of living spaces and habitats for endangered species, update of Red Lists.- Acquisition of land to safeguard the most vulnerable and important natural values, with priority on Natura 2000 and VEN sites with high nature values. - Support of local authorities (provincial and municipal authorities), regional landscape groups, NGO’s to enhance local actions for conservation measures and participation.- Transboundary cooperation for ensuring harmonised approaches for the management in transboundary nature and forest areas.- Cooperation with stakeholders to enhance their sense of responsibility in conservation and management efforts: management agreements with private and business sector; agri-environment agreements; financial and technical support for forest owners, hunting groups, fishermen groups. - Enhance the knowledge basis and monitoring to support and evaluate policy issues, deliver data for communication and reporting and develop the science-policy interface.- Promote communication on conservation of nature, forest and green spaces to enhance public awareness and participation.','Fl: http://www.lne.be/themas/beleid/beleidsplanning; http://natuurenbos.be; http://www.biodiversityindicators.be ','26/02/2010','','','15/03/2010',''),

	('Belgium',13,'B3_1_5','','One of the overarching principles of Belgium’s national strategy is sectoral integration. Objective 5 of the strategy focuses specifically on sectoral integration and targets stakeholder partnerships. This includes the involvement of the private sector and the land use planning for biodiversity.The regions are in charge of territorial matters and take responsibility for biodiversity-related issues including land use and spatial planning. The regional and the federal government administrations are the main implementation bodies for the national strategy. The provinces and the municipalities also play an important role at the local level, in accordance with regional policy.In the Flemish region, under the Cooperation Framework with local authorities municipalities receive financial and technical support for projects they submit for nature conservation actions. Half of these projects concerned acquisition and restoration of nature of forest areas. The other projects included species protection, installation of green roofs, development and implementation of management plans for parks and for road or river verges. An inter-departmental working group has been established for consultation on the review/development of the spatial plans for land use.  New executive spatial land use plans are being developed on regional, provincial and municipal level. For the over-arching regional level, Flanders has been divided in 15 regions. Several plans have been drafted based on the region\'s spatial vision that takes into account the proposals from the various sectors and identifies the key issues to be further discussed.Consultation groups on administrative level and on stakeholder level have been formally established for the development of the conservation objectives for the Natura 2000 sites to ensure a full participatory approach in this process. These consultation groups are active on a regional level following the overall regional process, as well as on the local level.In Wallonia, the 23 land use plans  (‘plans de secteur’) are aimed at managing the pressure from urbanisation by defining zones which can be built on (270,000 ha) and zones which should be reserved for agriculture, forests, or wildlife (1,400,000 ha). For the implementation of every urbanisation project under the framework of the ZACCs (zones d’aménagement communal concerté), an urban and environmental report evaluates the potential impacts.A participatory approach has been taken in Wallonia which contributes to biodiversity protection. Examples include:  Municipality plans for Nature development (PCDN), Nature Parks, and River Contracts (Contrats de Rivières). These include actions for biodiversity conservation on a local level. Other nature development programmes also exist which focus on “roadside management” (e.g. through delayed mowing). In 2007, 62 % of municipalities were involved in one or two programmes and 18 % in three programmes. Four were involved in all of the programmes. However, 47 municipalities were not yet involved in any programmesRiver contracts are an example of participatory management structures with the aim of bringing stakeholders together in water catchments in order to define a programme for restoring watercourses and their surrounding areas. 196 Walloon municipalities have become partners in a river contract. A platform has been set up to identify what could be improved for biodiversity conservation in the CWATUPE (Code wallon de l’aménagement du territoire, de l’urbanisme, du patrimoine et de l’énergie). In the Region of Brussels urbanization is a significant threat to biodiversity. The integration of biodiversity in land use policy presents a challenge.  Spatial planning in the Brussels Capital Region is organised by the Brussels code on spatial planning. This code specifies that environmental needs must be taken into account for the elaboration of the Regional Development Plan (art.17). This non restrictive plan establishes the Green & Bleu Network and is translated into a restrictive Regional Spatial Plan which includes special requirements for the protection of mapped high valued nature areas. Consultation of the interested stakeholders is organised by the Government for the elaboration of the RDP (the High Brussels Council for Nature Conservation).The management of green spaces is carried out in order to favour biodiversity. For instance, native species are used; dead trees are maintained as long as possible. Initiatives have been taken to encourage Eco-construction. A guide book on eco-construction for professionals was published with several chapters concerning biodiversity such as how to maximise ecological productivity, how to build green roofs, and how to set up green walls. Training workshops have also been organised for professionals.

The main objectives of these platforms is to look into (1) possible common programmes in which the actors agree to take up their responsibilities and through which the environmental performance can be improved; (2) cooperate for improving jurisdiction and instruments and sector specific objectives. The objectives of the Agency for Nature & Forests include other specific actions to enhance the integration of biodiversity concern and measures for conservation with socio-economic objectives:-	Aspects that are being explored include the development of incentive measures such as green taxes, support for land rehabilitation and restoration of nature and landscape values, support for private – public partnerships for biodiversity conservation actions-	New ways are being explored for effective integration of biodiversity into sectoral economic activities, such as improving the biodiversity content of environmental impact assessments, site management and conservation of biodiversity on domains of private companies, sustainable provision of raw materials, sustainable harvests and resource management, certification schemes,…-	Consultation group between Agency Nature & Forests, the Department Natural Resources and the Quarry Companies for sand and gravel exploitation to explore relation with biodiversity values and the proposed locations for the quarries, and discuss options for finding best solutions for limited impacts in the framework of EIAs, and for compensations and rehabilitation of natural values after their exploitation. For example with the sand mining company SIBELCO a cooperation agreement was developed to restore the natural values after the sand winning.-	With the private sector in energy production from biomass ways are explored for effective production and retail of biomass from the Agency’s nature and forest areas.-	Formal advisory boards have been established with several sector groups to enhance integration of biodiversity issues into their policies: agriculture, river fisheries, foresters, hunters.Wallonia:A certification scheme called PEFC involves all forest stakeholders: owners, industries, environment organizations, scientists, and other forests users.

No information on phosphorus concentrations in lakes was available.','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

This represents a slight increase (+0.01) since 1999, but an overall slight decrease (-0.01) since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication.

This represents an increase of 0.65 since 1999 and an overall increase of 0.63 in the past 20 years (1984-2004).','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

It has decreased by 0.05 between 1999 and 2004, and has decreased by 0.24 during the past 20 years (1984-2004). In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','The data does not include the EEZ of Faroe Is. and Greenland. From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx  Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Today, the water bathing quality along the 7,300 km of the Danish coasts is good, and the environmental authorities only discourage swimming along 10 km of the coast. Environmental assessment: a third decisive factor that secures sustainable tourism is the obligation for large tourist businesses (e.g. hotels, holiday resorts and amusement parks) to undergo a special environmental assessment before their construction is approved.Protection and restoration of nature : a fourth important aspect is the old Danish tradition of protecting natural areas by legislation.Environmental schemes: the majority of Danish tourist businesses and operators are conscious of the fact that a clean environment and a rich biodiversity nature are all-important prerequisites for them to make their living. Tourism has introduced a labelling scheme \"The Green Key\", for environmental quality as an addition to the state environmental schemes (\"the swan and the flower”).

The annual Danish timber production is approx. 2-2½ million cmb. Thus an estimated 5-6 cbm raw wood equivalents or just about 60-70 % are net imports, with the lions share in terms of volume being imported as construction wood and paper. No statistics account for the share of, for example, certified timber. An estimated 85-90 % of all imports of wood based products (per value) to Denmark is exported from other EU countries. A large share of the imports is supposed to originate from certified sources even if the timber is not sold and marketed as certified (due either lack of CoC-certification amongst Denmark retailers or lack of demand). The Danish government has declared a national target addressing timber trade and timber procurement. Thus, in the 2009 strategy on sustainable development (Growth with Care) it is stated that: The government will promote legal and sustainable forest management both through initiatives in relation to timber trade and through policy on public procurement of legal and sustainable timber. The goal is to eliminate the presence of illegally produced timber in the market and that public and private purchasers actively seek to buy legal and sustainable timber. To these ends the government supports the adoption of an ambitious EU due diligence regulation, which prohibits the marketing of illegal timber in the EU, and promotes a public procurement policy for timber aiming to increase public demand for verifiably legal and sustainable timber, e.g. verified by certified forest products.

On the lower level of planning one of the objectives of the County plan is to plan measures to ensure the preservation of natural resources, valuable arable land, landscapes and natural biotic communities, and the functioning of the green network, as well as take account, in planning, of protected areas and of the provisions for their use and, where necessary, to make proposals for the amendment of such provisions, the establishment of new protected areas or the termination of the protection regime. As a thematic plan for the County Plans the specified plans “Green Network” have been composed. The main aim of the “Green Network” plans is to prevent that the network will be fragmentized by the developments planned by the comprehensive and detailed plans. Through these regulations and plans the green network should be protected in Estonia, although there might sometimes be the problem that the green network protection is not always the first priority. As comprehensive and detailed plans can suggest changes in county plans, which can threaten the integrity of the green network. Also the conceptual basis and meaning of the green network should much more be explained to planners, as currently many cases within the green network are treated as social value and kept as recreational land for human beings, building sport facilities etc; it is not always understood to be kept as a migratory corridor network for wild species. As according to the Planning Act the national spatial plan shall be prepared in co-operation between the county governors, county local government associations and ministries; and a county plan in co-operation between the local governments of the planning area, the county governors of counties neighbouring the planning area, the Ministry of the Environment and other ministries whose area of government covers matters treated in the planning; we can say that there is a mechanism for interministerial coordination which addresses inclusion of ecological network considerations in spatial planning. Protection of the green network is covered by planning, but this, however, is not always considered sufficient legal protection. Also, compensatory measures for private properties that are in green corridors and therefore can be in principle restricted at their activities have not been drafted yet. In forestry in addition to a high proportion of forest cover and planned buffer zones around habitats, the Forest Act favours narrow clear-cut areas, strips along streams and waterbodies, maintaining key habitats and retention trees in commercial forests to strengthen coherence and connectivity.

Parameters related to soil faunistic or microbiological activity are herby mandatory.  In addition, projects have been undertaken to identify potential indicators for soil biodiversity. In 1995, a National Monitoring Programme started on earthworm diversity in Estonian agriculturally used soils (including natural grassland soils). Monitoring parameters included: abundance of earthworm community, number of species, abundance of species, ecological structure of community (relative importance of ecological groups), relative importance of dominant species Aporrectodea caliginosa in arable soils, microbial biomass SIR and respiration activity. In the framework of the Agri-Environmental (AE) Programme, the monitoring of earthworms and biomass activity started in 2004 and lasted until 2008. The number of monitoring sites was about 10-36, depending on the year. The goal of monitoring was to identify the impact of AE measures on soil biodiversity according to different farming types. The results indicate the positive influence of organic farming on the number of earthworm species, sensitive to farming and biomass activity. In 2009, the elaboration of a new soil biodiversity indicator – abundance and species diversity of Collembola – was started. If the method turns out to be suitable for description of arable land soil biodiversity, the introduction of a monitoring programme including the indicator will start. Other factors influencing soil biodiversity are monitored in the framework of the National Environmental Monitoring Programme (started in 1983), which currently involves 30 monitoring sites and has a monitoring interval of 5 years. It is responsible for especially monitoring parameters which describe the change in soil organic matter status by the use of the following parameters: depth of humus horizon, content of humus (%) and the stock of humus (t/ha). 2008/2009 results showed positive trends of organic matter status where in most of the monitoring sites the depth of humus horizon, content of humus and stock of humus had been stable or had slightly increased. Only for three monitoring sites out of 16, the parameters describing organic matter status had decreased. In addition, bulk density was determined at the same monitoring sites to observe the compaction of agricultural soils. Results showed an increasing trend towards more compacted soils, with potentially negative influence on soil biodiversity.Between 2006 and 2009, several studies were carried out to identify the geographical risk areas for wind and water erosion. The GIS queries and analyses of the Estonian soil map in conjunction with data from ARIB (Agricultural Registers and Information Board) indicated that soils vulnerable to water erosion exist on 40,000 ha of ARIB registered land, of which 16,000 ha is arable land. Although this finding means 40 per cent of agricultural land is at risk from water erosion, the proportion of arable land varies considerably from one county to another. The use of water erodible soils for arable land is greater in counties, in which intensity of erosion is low and the proportion of erodible soils is fairly small (27-54 per cent). Estimates, based on the GIS queries, indicated that wind erodible soils comprised approximately 100,000 ha of Estonia’s agricultural land, of which about 34 per cent are high wind erosion risk arable fields. The Universal Soil Loss Equation model enabled to estimate the average soil erosion intensity of fields covered by natural vegetation as a low rate of 0.04 t ha-1 y-1, even in the high risk areas (i.e counties where the eroded soils are wide spread). However, changes in land use from natural vegetation to intensively managed arable land accelerate the intensity of soil erosion to 0.43 t ha-1 y-1.','','Soil biodiversity refers to all organisms living in the soil, directly or indirectly effecting soil formation.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes.The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries. In addition, the average national nitrate concentration in one country may be strongly influenced by another country or countries upstream.

In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially over aggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx ','09/03/2010','     ','     ','10/12/2009','    04/05/2010 '),

The Planning Act enacts that one of the objectives of the National Spatial Plan is to create the basis for a system ensuring the preservation of various types of ecosystems and landscapes and balancing the impact of settlement systems and economic activities. The system is comprised of natural and semi-natural biotic communities (hereafter green network). The National Spatial Plan Estonia 2010 is in force until the end of 2000, and the new National Spatial Plan Estonia 2030+ is currently under preparation. On the lower level of planning, one of the objectives of the County plan is to determine measures to ensure the preservation of natural resources, valuable arable land, landscapes and natural biotic communities, as well as the functioning of the green network. Besides it seeks to take it into account in planning of protected areas and of the provisions for their use and, where necessary, to make proposals for the amendment of such provisions when establishing new protected areas or terminating a protection regime. As a thematic plan for the County Plans the specified “Green Network” plans have been composed. The main aim of the “Green Network” plans is to prevent fragmentation of the network by comprehensive planning. Through these regulations and plans the green network should be protected in Estonia, although there might sometimes be the problem that the protection is not always the first priority. In fact comprehensive and detailed plans can suggest changes in county plans, and therefore threaten the integrity of the green network. The conceptual basis and meaning of the green network need to be more explained to planners, as currently the green network areas are often treated as social and recreational values, but it is not always understood as a key migratory corridor network for wild species. According to the Planning Act, the national spatial plan shall be prepared in cooperation between the county governors, county local government associations and ministries; and the county plan in cooperation between the local governments of the planning area, the county governors of counties neighbouring the planning area, the Ministry of the Environment and other ministries whose area of government covers matters treated in the planning. There is also a sort of mechanism for interministerial coordination which addresses inclusion of ecological network considerations into spatial planning. Protection of the green network is covered by planning, but this, however, is not always considered sufficient legal protection. Also, compensatory measures for private properties located in green corridors are being drafted and will soon enable to restrict their activities. In forestry in addition to a high proportion of forest cover and planned buffer zones around habitats, the Forest Act favours narrow clear-cut areas, strips along streams and waterbodies, maintaining key habitats and retention trees in commercial forests to strengthen coherence and connectivity.','','   ','Reference or title:     Weblink:','03/03/2010','     ','','24/04/2010',''),

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

The reason why Angiosperms are classified as « unfavourable conservation status » is mainly the identification of poor or bad future prospects (climate change). Other species are declining because of other reasons. Bryophytes and pteridophytes are largely in unfavourable conservation status because of small distribution areas. Moreover, good quality habitats are insufficient for those groups of species. These results are confirmed by national red lists.The distribution of coastal and aquatic species is largely declining, whereas the distribution of species typical of forests and grasslands is rather increasing. The conservation status of Mammals and Reptiles, and, to a lesser extent, Insects is rather encouraging compared to the conservation status of Fishes and Amphibians.Unknown conservation status is rather large for species in France because some groups did not benefit in 2007 and before from accurate monitoring and experts (lichens, mosses). For animal species, assessment criteria were not fully accurate. The distinction between biogeographical zones was not pertinent for some animal species.','','The conservation status of birds is presented as percentage of Least Concern, Near-threatened and Red-listed at global level of the total of regularly occurring species.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication.

Furthermore, 90 per cent of the Atlantic grassland habitats have an unfavourable status, the status of the remaining 10 per cent is unknown. Of the Mediterranean grassland habitats in France, the majority (69 per cent) have an unfavourable status, 8 per cent have a favourable conservation status and the status of the remaining 23 per cent is unknown. All of the Atlantic and continental heath and scrub habitat in France has an unfavourable conservation status while 67 per cent of both the alpine and Mediterranean heath and scrub habitat have a status that is unfavourable (the remaining 33 per cent in both cases have a favourable status). All of the 27 occurrences of peat land habitats in France (Atlantic, continental, alpine and Mediterranean) have an unfavourable conservation status. With regards to the forest habitats in France, 93 per cent of the Atlantic forest habitats in France have an unfavourable conservation status (the status of the remaining Atlantic forest habitats are unknown). 57 per cent of alpine forest habitats have an unfavourable status, 14 per cent have a favourable status (of the remaining 28 per cent, the status of 21 per cent is unknown while 7 per cent were unreported). 63 per cent of the continental foret habitats in France have an unfavourable status, 19 per cent have a favourable status while the status of the remaining 19 per cent is unknown. Finally, of the Mediterranean forest habitats in France, 72 per cent have an unfavourable status, 17 per cent have a favourable status and the conservation status of the remaining 11 per cent is unknown. See under ‘Additional clarifications’ below for the detailed data.According to reporting by the Member State, heath and scrub habitats are rather in a good conservation status because their repartition is not declining and pressures are low. However grasslands are most of the time in unfavourable conservation status (especially in Continental and Atlantic biogeographical zones) because their area is declining. In Mediterranean and Alpine biogeographical zones the status is more favourable.','','A break down of conservation status at the biogeographical level is shown below for each habitat type.Status of grassland habitatsALL BIONumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage463664078%13%9%0%            ATLNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage10901090%0%10%0%U11  U28       ContinentalNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage1111000100%0%0%0%U13   U28       AlpineNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage12750058%42%0%0%U16  U21       MediterraneanNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage13913069%8%23%0%U16  U23       Status of forest habitatsALL BIONumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage624489171%13%15%2%            AtlanticNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage141301093%0%7%0%U17  U26       ContinentalNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage161033063%19%19%0%U16   U24       AlpineNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage14823157%14%21%7%U15  U23       MediterraneanNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage181332072%17%11%0%U16  U27       Status of heath and scrub habitatsALL BIONumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage191630084%16%0%0%            AtlanticNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage55000100%0%0%0%U11  U24       ContinentalNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage55000100%0%0%0%U13   U22       AlpineNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage6420067%33%0%0%U13  U21       MediterraneanNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage3210067%33%0%0%U12  U20       Status of peat land habitats ALL BIONumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage2727000100%0%0%0%            AtlanticNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage88000100%0%0%0%U12  U26       ContinentalNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage77000100%0%0%0%U12   U25       AlpineNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage88000100%0%0%0%U13  U25       MediterraneanNumber OccurrencesU1+U2NumbersFVNumbersXXNumbersNANumbersU1+U2PercentageFVPercentageXXPercentageNAPercentage44000100%0%0%0%U12  U22       ','Reference or title: HD Article 17 report, MS questionnaireWeblink: http://biodiversity.eionet.europa.eu/article17/ and http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/env/monnat/library?l=/habitats_reporting/reporting_2001-2007&vm=detailed&sb=Title ','24/02/2010','','','','12/05/2010'),

This is a slight decrease since 1999 (-0.05) and an overall increase since 1984 (+0.05). ','','From Pauly (2005): Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Technically, the identification of demands of patents concerning biodiversity is very difficult with the present databases and supposes a considerable work of information collection. Indeed, the international classification of patents and the request by keywords do not allow to precisely determining the demands of patents that would relate to genetic resources. There is also the problem of the European and international demands concerning the national level and the problem, as well, of national demands not concerning our country. The origin of genetic resources is not necessarily filled in. Financing biodiversity management: In France, the “accounts of biodiversity” distinguish the financing for the management of natural sites and species, the financing for knowledge, the financing for the reduction of pressures and the financing for other biodiversity-related actions. This indicator also distinguishes the main categories of organisations involved.   Additional indicators: Number of plant varieties;Natural area lost per year (\"Surface artificialisée annuellement\");Leaf deficit index;Forest area  with guarantee for sustainable management and ratio compared to total wooded area;Dominance of natural and semi-natural ecosystems in the landscape;Trend in the pollutant content in waters.',' Reference or title: EEA survey SEBI 2010 and National Biodiversity Indicators, 2009Weblink:','24/02/2010','','','09/12/2009','12/05/2010'),

Moreover a study about the opportunity to use a similar method for calcareous grasslands will be conducted in 2010.The cartography of all natural habitats will contribute to monitor the extent of Natura 2000 habitats. The methodology will be finalised in 2010. First results will be available before the next reporting period (article 17).Several local and regional monitoring schemes exist in France.BirdsCoordinated by the research centre on bird populations biology –National Museum of Natural HistoryFrench breeding bird survey (STOC) A breeding bird survey (BBS) was started in France in 1989 following two methods inspired from the North American BBS and the British Constant Effort Site (CES). Both methods are based on volunteer skilled ornithologists counting birds in a standardized way at the same site for several years. For the BBS type of survey, individuals are counted on permanent plots during a fixed period of 5 min, counting visible individuals and singers. To be validated, the count must be repeated on approximately the same date of the year (7 days within April to mid-June), the same time of the day (15 min within 1–4 h after sunrise), by the same observer. Each observer counts for 10 plots in the same morning, plots being at least 200m apart. Counts within these groups are summed before analysis. For the CES type of survey, individuals are counted by means of trapping with mist-nets and are marked with individually numbered metal rings allowing further identification, thus avoiding double counting. The number and placement of mist-nets are fixed within a trapping site, as well as the number and date of trapping sessions (three to five, between May and mid-July).Winter farmland bird survey A winter farmland bird monitoring was started in France in 2009, to complete the information given by the French breeding bird survey . Two counts are conducted each winter. In a 5 km radius circle chosen by the participant, 5 parcels are chosen, (being at least 1 km apart) in which the crop the most abundant in the region is grown, along a 300m transect crossing the parcel. All individuals seen on the ground or flying over the parcel are counted.All surveys below are coordinated by the research unit  7204 (CNRS- National Museum of Natural History)  “species conservation, restauration and population monitoring”Mammals French common bat surveyA common bat survey was started in France in 2006, following a protocol based on detection and recording of time expanded calls, involving a network of volunteers, counting bats in a standardized way at the same site for several years. Each area is surveyed twice a year (1st: 15 June 15 July, 2nd : 15 August 30 September). Two methods co-exist: road survey and point count. For the road survey: the volunteers choose a route of 30 km and a random starting point is defined by the lab. Recording are made on ten segments of 2km each, driven at 25 km/h. For the point count: individuals are counted on permanent plots during a fixed period of 5 min, counting visible individuals and singers. Each observer counts for 10 plots in a square of 2x2 km, 5 plots being located in the typical habitats of the square and the 5 others in habitats favourable to bats.Invertebrates French Rhopalocera  survey (STERF)A butterfly survey was started in France in 2006 following the method developed for the British Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates, 1993). It involves volunteer skilled entomologists, counting butterflies in a standardized way at the same site for several years. The counts are conducted 3 to 5 times a year along 5 to 15 fixed 10 minutes transects (100 to 500m depending on butterflies richness), each with a homogeneous habitat type. The fieldworkers record all butterflies 2.5 metres to their right, 2.5 metres to their left, 5 metres ahead of them and 5 metres above them (Van Swaay et al., 2002). Butterfly counts are conducted between March-April to September-October depending on the region. Visits are only conducted when weather conditions meet specified criteria. Individuals of every species observed are counted. Garden butterflies surveyStarted in 2006, the garden butterflies survey involves volunteers from the general public. Every month from March to October, in the garden they have chosen, participants count individuals of 28 selected butterflies species, (identification tool provided): counts are made at a chosen frequency. Only the maximum number of individuals seen at the same time is recorded for each month, and for each species. Similar protocols were developed in 2009 for garden snails and bumble-bees.Plants French common plant monitoring (Vigie-Flore)A common plant survey was started in France in 2009, involving a network of volunteer skilled botanists conducting inventories in a standardized way at the same site for several years. A 1x1 km square systematically sampled within a 10x10 km square is allocated to each participant. 8 plots are positioned in this square along a systematic grid pattern. All the species are inventoried (1m² square, ten repetitions) at each spot.','','','Reference or title:Weblink:','24/02/2010','','','12/05/2010',''),

According to reporting by the Member State, the German Common Breeding Bird Survey (GCBBS) is the main scheme for monitoring German common and widespread breeding bird species. It covers the main habitat and landscape types all over Germany including farmland and forests. The species indices are computed using a software package named TRIM which allows for missing counts in the time series and yields unbiased yearly values and standard errors using Poisson regression. The data from GCBS and other bird monitoring programmes feed into the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD), which reflects the conservation status of the landscape as well as the sustainability of land use. SISD summarizes the trends in abundance of 59 selected, representative breeding bird species. 10 bird species were chosen to represent farmland, 11 bird species to represent forests. The issue of the conservation status of the habitat types and the issue of sustainability become part of the indicator construction by defining target values: an expert panel has determined a target value for every single bird species, which should be attained by 2015, provided that the guidelines for sustainable development and nature conservation are completely implemented. After standardisation of the population sizes at 100% for the 2015 goal for all selected species, the deviation in percentage from those values can be computed for any individual year. Sub-indicators of the habitat types of farmland and forests are calculated. The SISD starts in 1990 and is updated annually. For 1970 and 1975, historical reference values were reconstructed. SISD is used in Germany on a national scale for assessment of sustainability and biodiversity issues in the context of the German National Sustainability Strategy, the German National Strategy on Biological Diversity and the programme of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).Between the years 1990 and 2007, Germany’s national farmland bird indicator and Germany’s national forest bird indicator have shown no clearly positive or negative trend. In 2007, the farmland bird indicator was at 68 per cent and the forest bird indicator at 76 per cent of the target value determined for the year 2015. For the two indicators, 10 farmland bird species and 11 forest bird species were monitored.A new monitoring program has been set up nationwide to implement the HNV Farmland Indicator in Germany.  The HNV Farmland area will be calculated by mapping stratified random sample areas of low intensity agricultural land and landscape features. Using the 2009 mapping sample an initial estimate of the HNV Farmland 2009 area will be available early in 2010. Following this a quarter of the intended total sample will be mapped each year by the Federal States. A running mean of the indicator value will then be available every 2 years at the national level and for each Federal State.','','This Measure of Progress indicates progress regarding the mandatory baseline and impact indicators as well as additional programme-specific indicators related to biodiversity, to establish a Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework under Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.','Reference or title: MS questionnaire, German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN 2009)Weblink: http://www.bfn.de/0315_nachhaltigkeit.html References concerning population of farmland birds:1) Achtziger, R., Stickroth, H. & Zieschank, R.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries. In addition, the average national nitrate concentration in one country may be strongly influenced by another country or countries upstream.

This represents an average decrease of 0.11 since 1999 and an average decrease of 0.22 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','Within the EEZ of the North Sea and of the Baltic Sea in 2004 the German Government nominated ten protected areas in line with the Habitat and Birds Directives and for which Germany will have to establish management plans until 2013. Since 2007, these ten protected areas are part of the European Natura 2000 network and provide for one third of the German EEZ. The MTI includes all the German EEZ and thus includes these N2000 protected areas. Germany marine trophic level index split between two seas:North Sea: MTI 2004=2.92. Change 1999-2004=-0.11, Change 1984-2004=-0.12Baltic Sea: MTI=3.27. Change 1999-2004=-0.11, Change 1984-2004=-0.32The numbers in the table above are the averages from the marine trophic index of the two seas. The situation is similar for both seas separately, showing a decreasing trend in marine trophic index. From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot be guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.In the case of Germany, it would have to be further investigated whether the Index also allows for conclusions regarding the origin of landings so as to provide for the possibility to specifically assess the German EEZ.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Some of these are binding for further project approval procedures, some must be considered when balancing interests. Provisions included in these spatial plans may refer to all uses and protective functions of a given space, including environmental protection. Environmental issues must also be taken into account when taking decisions on other aspects, e.g. economic uses. This results from the general logic of spatial planning law and is laid down in particular in section 2(2) no. 6 of the Federal Regional Planning Act. The fourth sentence expressly calls for decisions to be made in such a way as to pay attention to the requirements of the ecological network.Moreover, with regard to the establishment and protection of the European Natura 2000 network pursuant to section 7 (6) of the Regional Planning Act, impact assessments in accordance with the European Habitats and Birds Directives (92/43/EEC and 79/409/EEC) must be carried out when making spatial plans.Pursuant to section 9 (1), first sentence, no. 1 of the Regional Planning Act, a strategic environmental assessment must be carried out when developing spatial plans, identifying expected significant effects of the spatial plan on biological diversity (among other aspects) and describing and evaluating them in a detailed environmental report. This provision transposes Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (Official Journal EC No. L 197 p.30).The environmental effects of the implementation of the plan must be monitored in accordance with section 9 (4) of the Regional Planning Act. Monitoring measures must be promulgated at the same time as the spatial plan.

However, the previous Regional Planning Act which had been in force since summer 2004 contained comparable provisions.With regard to the question on \"interministerial coordination which addresses inclusion of ecological network considerations in spatial planning\" it should be noted that, although there is no such special coordination, there is a \"ministerial conference for spatial planning\". The conference has various subcommittees and working groups in which the competent ministries for regional planning at Federal and Land level discuss general spatial planning issues, see section 26 (1) of the Regional Planning Act. These bodies can also deal with ecological network considerations in spatial planning, if appropriate.

According to the obligations under article 11 of the Habitats Directives member states of the European Union shall establish monitoring programmes to assess the conservation status of the species listed in the annexes II, IV and V (as well as habitat types of annex I). These data shall provide a sound basis for the national reports given by the member states every 6 years. The last national report provided by Germany in 2007 covers the timeframe from 2001 until 2006. It was based on heterogeneous data provided by the German federal states nature conservation agencies and additional expert opinion since a nation wide monitoring plan with standardized methods was lacking. For the ongoing reporting period (2007–2012) the German Länder (federal states) and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation developed a harmonized monitoring plan that started in 2008. Taking into account some statistical settings and agreements, in Germany annex species and habitat types with more than 63 occurrences within a given biogeographical region are sampled at 63 randomly chosen localities. For species or habitat types with a lower number of occurrences all known localities are included into the monitoring. For each species or habitat type, always the same localities were covered by the monitoring (constant plots), as long as the species resp. habitat type is present there. Species and habitat type specific assessment schemes define the relevant parameters to be recorded and assessed (using threshold values) during the field work at the sampled localities. Species population monitoring is mainly based on semi-quantitative field methods e. g. egg mass counts, calling surveys, line transect counts rather than more time-consuming capture mark recapture techniques. The Monitoring under the Habitats Directive in Germany is an overview surveillance mainly to provide data for the national report.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes.

This represents an increase of 0.22 since 1999, but a decrease of 0.04 since 1984.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Aerial power lines pose a serious threat to wild bird populations due to electrocution and collision. For several endangered species, power lines are among the most important causes of mortality. An agreement was prepared and signed in February 2008 on collaboration among all distribution companies as well as the Ministry of Environment and Water and BirdLife Hungary to minimise bird mortality along power lines. Funding is provided mainly through the Structural Funds (Environment and Energy Operational Programme), LIFE Nature and LIFE+, but thanks to the improving co-operation, distribution companies also co-finance the projects. Most prominent recent examples are the burial of 80 km of medium-voltage power lines in the Hortobágy National Park (Structural Funds), the burial of 11 km of medium voltage power lines in the Borsodi Mezőség Landscape Protection Area (LIFE Nature) and the fitting of bird diverters on 45 km of medium and high voltage power lines in some of the most important Great Bustard sites in Hungary to avoid collision (LIFE Nature). Presently running projects include two LIFE Nature projects (focussing on Saker Falcon and Red-footed Falcon) aiming at the insulation of a total of 910 km of medium voltage power lines. There is an important, self-financed initiative by the Hungarian high-voltage electricity distribution company to fit high-voltage power lines with markers where there are conflicts with the most important bird habitats. Under the agreement, BirdLife Hungary, commissioned by the Ministry of Environment and Water, produced a conflict map in late 2008 to prioritise all power lines in Hungary as to the urgency of bird-friendly conversion. The total length of top priority power lines is 21,700 km. Based on this figure, the funding needed to convert all top priority power lines is in the order of 60 million euros. The plan is to eliminate most of this threat by 2020. Under the agreement, and based on regular consultations with all partners concerned, distribution companies have also prepared and constantly update BAT (best available technology) for the creation of bird-friendly power lines where new power lines are set up. The BAT documentation is available in Hungarian. BirdLife Hungary has set up a national database of all observed bird casualties and runs yearly surveys to monitor certain power lines. The Act on Nature Conservation No. 53 of 1996 was also amended in December 2008 to only allow bird-friendly technologies at new or fully renewed power lines. Locations of particular importance to birds are carefully considered in the planning phase, especially since Hungary’s accession to the European Union, as the requirement of an appropriate assessment is compulsory also in Special Protection Areas under the Birds Directive.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

The document was finalised and approved by Parliament in 2009 and aims to ameliorate the quality of environment, the sustainable use of the natural resources, the protection of the natural heritage and the enhancement of environmental security, as the most important elements for the improvement of the quality of life and the enforcement of the constitutional right to a healthy environment. The Programme uses a complex approach to realise these objectives by the horizontal integration of environmental aspects, and by the implementation of the goals and measures of the thematic action plans, considering the priorities of the EU 6th Environmental Action Programme and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. The thematic action plans include the description of the actual situation, the targets and the measures to reach these goals, as well as the indicators helping the monitoring of the implementation. These nine thematic action plans are as follows: 1.enforcement of the environmental thinking and approach; 2.climate change; 3.health and environment; 4.environmental quality of settlements; 5.biodiversity preservation, nature and landscape protection; 6.	sustainable field and land use; 7.protection and sustainable use of our waters; 8.waste management; 9.environmental security.

Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication.

The Foreshore Act, 1933 (as amended) governs the regulation and granting of consents regarding activities or developments below the line of high water of ordinary or medium tides with 12 nautical miles being the outer limit.  With regard to development above the high water mark, since the Local Government Act of 2001, the maritime boundaries of cities, counties and towns are deemed to coincide with the ordinary high water mark (except where such boundaries already extend beyond that high water mark). - It is envisaged that the measures outlined will ensure greater cohesion between the consent systems for below and above the high water mark leading to a more integrated management of the coastal zone and coastal marine environment.The status of the development of a Marine Spatial Strategy / Coastal Zone Management Policy was reported and summarised as follows:  - The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government as part of the foreshore modernisation process, in collaboration with the Marine Institute and other key stakeholders intend to bring forward proposals to develop a marine spatial planning framework (including integrated Coastal Zone Management). This will clarify allowable location/type of development on the foreshore (and beyond the foreshore limits) to guide/direct decision-makers and users towards appropriate spatial uses of the foreshore and the efficient, sustainable use of marine resources. This process will ensure a more integrated approach between the existing planning system and the marine environment.  - Integrated coastal zone management is currently supported by the planning system. Since its inception, the planning system has had a broad remit, not only in the proper planning of our land resources but also in environmental protection and will continue to play a major part in relation to coastal zone management.  - The Planning and Development Act, 2000 was introduced to ensure that the Irish planning system can face the challenges meeting the country as it continues to grow and prosper. New requirements for forward and strategic planning have been introduced. A sustainable development ethos has been explicitly incorporated into the planning system. Under the provisions of the Act, each local planning authority must prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.  - The 2000 Planning and Development Act provides that a planning authority’s development plan may include objectives for, inter alia: Regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding (whether inland or coastal), erosion and other natural hazards;  regulating, restricting and controlling the development of coastal areas and development in the vicinity of inland waterways;  regulating, restricting and controlling development on the foreshore, or any part of the foreshore.','','','','23/04/2010','','','27/04/2010',''),

The programme was initiated in response to declines in angling catches of these important recreational species and the paucity of knowledge about these species in Irish waters. Approximately 40,000 elasmobranchs have been tagged to date. Up to 2006, a total of16,804 blue shark (Prionace glauca) were tagged, with 813 recaptured (Green et al, 2008).

Data from a subset of 10 skippers/boats representing vessels that have been under the same skippers and have used uniform fishing methods since 1989 confirms this trend.

This represents an increase of 0.02 since 1999 and an increase of 0.17 since 1984.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries.

Paradoxically data source affected in a more evident way evaluations about critically endangered habitat types like peat bogs. Sometimes positive evaluations on the conservation status are due to the fact that some seminatural habitat types of community interest, still common across the whole national territory (e.g. habitat type 6210 and 6220), maintain a good conservation status owing to an ancient coexistence between sheep farming and natural environment.Furthermore the almost complete impossibility of evaluating quantitatively the favourable reference values (FRVs) could have induced to more positive evaluations of the conservation status.

Requirements take into account biodiversity and environmental concerns regarding forest management and forbid the use of non-native or not naturalised species in afforestation activities. More detailed provisions are available according to regional legislation, as the Regions are responsible for regulating forest management.Deforestation activities are usually not allowed following national forest legislation N. 3267/1923 and N. 227/2001. Change from forest to other forms of land used is only allowed for small, authorised and registered areas.

','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

A dynamic indicator-based approach to the assessment of multi-stock fisheries has been applied to the data series obtained from Medits surveys (since 1994) by an international working group involving all the scientific teams contributing to the data collection process. A suite of population and community indicators, matching the ones proposed by the guidelines (SGRN 08-01), calculated from the Medits data and applied to areas defined according to the GFCM geographical units, have been already analysed by the Medits international working group.

A set of simple indicators related to fishing impact on fish populations and communities were estimated from the MEDITS time-series data. The criteria for selecting the indicators for measuring fishing impacts on the population and community levels were that they should easily and reliably (with high precision) be calculated with the available MEDITS survey information and the direction of change under the impact of fishing should be known. According to these criteria, four indicators of population state, intrinsic population growth rate, total mortality, mean length and length at maturity, and five indicators of community state, total abundance and biomass, mean individual weight and length and the proportion of large individuals (across all species) were selected.The MEDIAS survey will record data necessary to assess indicators 1-3 of Appendix XIII in the scope of the pelagic ecosystem. Particular attention is given to the presence of species which could be affected by changes in climate and in the ecosystem structure, e.g. Sprattus sprattus (sprat) distribution and abundance in the Adriatic and Lessepsian migrants. All species caught are identified and registered (code 1); maximum mean length and proportion of large fish (codes 2 and 3) are registered for small pelagic fishes based on the net sampling.

It would be based on the total area of grids (3 km x 3 km) within which 90% of VMS records were obtained, each month.Indicator 7: Areas not impacted by mobile bottom gearsIndicator of the area of seabed that has not been impacted by mobile bottom fishing gears in the last year. It responds to changes in the distribution of bottom fishing activity resulting from catch controls, effort controls or technical measures (including MPAs established in support of conservation).The use of VMS apparatus started mainly as a control tool for the application of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries’ resources. The so-called “blue box”, i.e. an on-board system allowing a fishing vessel to be tracked remotely, is one of the measures that the European Commission adopted under Regulation (EC) No. 2371/2002). The Regulation provides that, beginning on 1st of January 2005, fishing vessels with an overall length exceeding 15 m “shall have installed on board a functioning system which allows detection and identification of that vessel by remote monitoring systems”. Subsequent Regulation (EC) No. 2244/2003 lays down more detailed provisions. VMS data represent a useful tool for management purposes as well, and are fully compatible with graphic rendering and interpretation through the GIS. The VMS database contains a huge amount of data, and a careful and long job of data “cleaning” will be necessary, since quality of data is imperative for its use in resource management. It will be necessary as well the separation between signals coming from the vessel during navigation and those transmitted during fishing activity, and their selection according to different fishing system. This data will be crossed with other sources of data: - Vessel Register, containing information about Boat characteristic (OL, GT, KW, fishing license...);- Logbook, containing vessel ID and information on the gear used. This allows the identification of the vessel to métier level 4. Logbook information usually includes retained catches of the main commercial species on a trip by trip basis and at the scale of an ICES rectangle. This information allows the identification of the vessel to métier level 5 or 6.VMS and logbook information needs to be processed in order to better describe fishingactivity for use in the three pressure indicators. Different methods are used to:• Identify fishing activity;• Create fishing tracks;• Define métiers.At first, it is necessary to distinguish fishing activity from other activities (e.g., steaming). This is possible by using both information data about boat activity (the “blue box” code) and vessel speed. These two sources of information have to be combined in different ways for the different metiers. The time frequency of VMS position returns for Italian vessels is 20 minutes. According to the Report of the Working Group on the Ecosystem Effects of Fishing Activities (WGECO), this is a very short intervals (< 0.5 h), so that it is likely that many fewer unaccounted movements have been undertaken and joining points by straight lines is reasonable. Métier level 4 describes gear types. Level 5 describes trawl with species (i.e., otter trawl and plaice), while métier level 6 is a specific description based on the catch. The DGMARE request indicates that activity information is required disaggregated to métier level 6. This level is based on the catch composition. However, level 6 (mesh size) corresponds to level 5 for what concern trawlers (for the bottom and pelagic trawl the minimum mesh size is 40 and 20 mm respectively, Reg. 1967/06/CE). Regarding the small scale fishery, all the different mesh sizes have been aggregated at level 5. According to the WGECO, the key information would be about the vessels and its gear, so down to métier level 5. If this is agreed, it should significantly reduce the data volume needed to address the request and have no impact on the conclusions. The approach used to define métiers at level 5 consists in a quantitative analysis of logbook data, which were directly combined with information gathered from VMS. The results will permit to describe the distribution of activity of fishing boats (over 15 metres long), linking descriptive with “operative” information. All the calculation has been made with the R software, in agreement with the other experiences carried out for indicators 1-4. Definition of indicator 5, in particular, foresees the selection of signals during fishing activity, and can be defined according to the main different fishing system. With this purpose, exercises and case studies were already performed and utilized for activities of technical assistance to the Directorate of Fisheries, as well as in framework of the project “Construction of a GIS supporting management processes in maritime fishing and aquaculture sectors…in the framework of EFF (European Fishing Fund)”. This exercises made possible the identification of the geographical and temporal distribution of fishing boats considered.Definition of  indicator 6 needs the elaboration of “frequency areas” for signals coming from different kind of fishing systems, and their assemblage according to their frequencies in the different geographical areas (GSA as a reference), and this could fit with the definition of indicator 6.Last indicator (N. 7 “Areas not impacted by mobile bottom gears”) can only partly derived from the elaborations of number 5. It foresees the use and the crossing among different sources of data, as the areas subject to a kind of total or partial protection (both geographical and temporal), or dedicated to different activities. The presence of the majority of this data already stored in a GIS will facilitate their use according to the specific goal.It has to be noted, as a final note, that the definition of all the three indicators will be covered by the VMS data only for the fishing fleet over 15 metres long.','Italian National Program under Council Regulation No 199/2008 and Commission Regulation No 665/2008.

In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','*Italy has never declared an EEZ. Maritime limits and boundaries depicted on Sea Around Us Project maps are not to be considered as an authority on the delimitation of international maritime boundaries. These maps are drawn on the basis of the best information available to the project. Where no maritime boundary has been agreed, theoretical equidistance lines have been constructed. Where a boundary is in dispute, the project attempt to show the claims of the respective parties where these are known and show areas of overlapping claims. In areas where a maritime boundary has yet to be agreed, it should be emphasized that these maps are not to be taken as the endorsement of one claim over another.From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.Italy also provided the following clarification: Currently Italy has not established an EEZ, but is planning to establish a EPZ in the northern Tirrenic Sea, according to law n. 61/2006.Moreover there are bilateral agreements regarding the continental shelf in offshore waters:- Agreement between the Republic of Albania and the Republic of Italy for the determination of the continental shelf of each of the two countries 18 December 1992 (entry in force 26/02/1999)- Agreement between the Hellenic Republic and the Italian Republic on the delimitation of the respective continental shelf areas of the two States, 24 May 1977 (entry into force: 12 November 1980- Agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries in the Adriatic Sea (entry in force 21/01/1970)- Convention between Spain and Italy on the delimitation of the continental shelf between the two States, 19 February 1974 (entry into force: 16 November 1978)- Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Tunisia and the Government of the Italian Republic concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries, 20 August 1971 (entry into force: 6 December 1978)- Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Italian Republic on the Delimitation of maritime frontiers in the area of the straights of Bonifacio, 28 November 1986 (entry into force: 15 May 1989).','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx ','','na','','10/12/2009','na'),

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication.

The Structure Plan aims to influence the quality and distribution of land uses through a set of sectoral and area-based policies that take into account the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the Maltese Islands. The objective of this national planning tool is three-fold. The Structure Plan provides guidance to Local Plans and gives a general direction for development and strives to conserve and enhance the countryside and promote integrated land and water planning. The Structure Plan encompasses a variety of policies, including RCO Policies, which aim towards the conservation of natural habitats, natural features and the landscape. The said RCO Policies provide conservation measures with respect to a number of issues ranging from ecology, to rehabilitation of degraded habitats and landscapes to agricultural land.In addition, ecological corridors in Malta are considered to be essential for the coherence, connectivity and resilience of the natural environment.

','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

The MEDITS survey is performed in order to collect data on abundance and biological aspects of benthic and demersal species. The MCFS is also involved in another initiative known as MedLEM. MedLEM is a monitoring programme on the capture and sightings of the large cartilaginous fishes occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. This initiative contributes to the knowledge and conservation of the sharks by following a common protocol to collect data in the Mediterranean Basin. Due to the fact that this survey is carried out on a regular basis it is deemed as monitoring.Moreover, Malta (through the MCFS) has been collecting data under the Data Collection Regulation (DCR; EC 1639/01) now superseded, by the Data Collection Framework (DCF; EC 949/08), since 2005. In the new DCF period (i.e. 2011-2013), sharks have been included with other species and hence data will be collected under this framework. However, detailed data on sharks and rays began in 2007 during the MEDITS trawl survey (which is also part of the DCR/DCF). Seabirds: Malta holds approximately 10% of the world’s Yelkouan Shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) population, the largest breeding population of European Storm-petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) in the Mediterranean and significant colonies of Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). BirdLife Malta carries out an annual monitoring of the breeding colonies of these seabird populations.  This work is undertaken at key breeding sites on Malta, such as Rdum tal-Madonna and Gozo.  Other research carried out includes the Comino Bird Ringing Project, and ringing activities in nature reserves at Ghadira, Is-Simar and on the island of Filfla, a Bird Sanctuary designated for its breeding colony of European Storm-petrels.Another type of monitoring activity carried out in Malta is bird ringing which has been ongoing since 1965. Bird ringing is an important conservation tool to investigate aspects of bird ecology and biology such as survival rates, population age structure, breeding success rates and migration.  Understanding migration patterns is particularly important in terms of international conservation, as an understanding of migratory routes provides crucial information for the planning of integrated systems of protected areas.  Through the ongoing LIFE funded project “Monitoring and Conservation of Shearwaters and Petrels in the Maltese Islands (GARNIJA-MALTIJA)” a study was carried out with the aim of assessing the perceptions of fishers on seabird by-catch and to undertake a preliminary evaluation – using a questionnaire – of the impact of the Maltese fishing fleet on incidental by-catches of birds.

These Natura 2000 sites with management plans cover alltogether ~45,000 ha. Requirements concerning the contents of the management plans were laid down in the 275/2004 (X. 8.) govermental regulation. The plans were prepared by a consortium (members: Szent István University Gödöllő -Institute of Environmental and Landscape Management; VÁTI Hungarian Public Nonprofit Limited Liability Company for Regional Development and Town Planning; Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Institute of Ecology and Botany ) in close cooperation with the Ministry of Environment and Water and national park directorates since the plans are supposed to serve as samples for the preparation of further management plans. It is important to emphasize that the Hungarian regulation prescribes a management plan for each protected area in form of an act of the minister responsible for nature protection. Consequently, in many Natura 2000 areas the main necessary management requirements have already been put in force in form of a management plan as well. This concerns an overlap with Natura 2000 on 53,684 ha, involving parts or complete 29 Natura 2000 sites (21 SCI, 8 SPA). Protected areas with a management plan in preparation cover 545,707 ha, and fully or partly overlap with 146 (118 SCI, 28 SPA) Natura 2000 sites. The figures of the table take into account the management plans that affect Natura 2000 and protected areas as well.In frame of LIFE projects management plans have been already prepared for 9 SPA, and the preparation of management plans for 4 SCI is in process. We also would like to highlight that Hungary has identified High Nature Value Farmland Areas (HNVFA) in order to maintain the favourable condition of those agricultural areas which can be considered as environmentally sensitive and also play a very important role in saving biological diversity. The feasibility studies of the HNVFAs contain the detailed review of the areas particularly focusing on the natural values and reasonable land use prescriptions. The 25 HNVFAs fully or partly overlap with 128 Natura 2000 sites (101 SCI and 27 SPA). It means that the most important requirements for farming have been identified on 50% (476,645 ha) of the utilized agricultural area of the Natura 2000 network, so that in effect these studies play the role of management plans for the overlapping Natura 2000 sites.Moreover, Hungary is in a special situation since a significant share of the protected - and in addition Natura 2000 – areas are state owned. More than 55% of this territory (154,000 ha) is managed by local farmers. The land use contracts between the national park directorates and farmers contain in every case the management commitments that have to be fulfilled in course of the farming activities. Obviously, the interests of Natura 2000 network are considered by the definition of land use prescriptions in first place.It is also of high importance that the approval of the MoEW is needed in case of each plan for forestry management. Meanwhile, the review of previously validated forest management plans on Natura 2000 sites is still in progress and will have been finished by 2010.','','','Reference or title:Weblink:','15/02/2010','','','07/05/2010',''),

Aerial power lines pose a serious threat to wild bird populations due to electrocution and collision. For several endangered species, power lines are among the most important causes of mortality. An agreement was prepared and signed in February 2008 on collaboration among all distribution companies as well as the Ministry of Environment and Water and BirdLife Hungary to minimise bird mortality along power lines. Funding is provided mainly through the Structural Funds (Environment and Energy Operational Programme), LIFE Nature and LIFE+, but thanks to the improving co-operation, distribution companies also co-finance the projects. Most prominent recent examples are the burial of 80 km of medium-voltage power lines in the Hortobágy National Park (Structural Funds), the burial of 11 km of medium voltage power lines in the Borsodi Mezőség Landscape Protection Area (LIFE Nature) and the fitting of bird diverters on 45 km of medium and high voltage power lines in some of the most important Great Bustard sites in Hungary to avoid collision (LIFE Nature). Presently running projects include two LIFE Nature projects (focussing on Saker Falcon and Red-footed Falcon) aiming at the insulation of a total of 910 km of medium voltage power lines. There is an important, self-financed initiative by the Hungarian high-voltage electricity distribution company to fit high-voltage power lines with markers where there are conflicts with the most important bird habitats. Under the agreement, BirdLife Hungary, commissioned by the Ministry of Environment and Water, produced a conflict map in late 2008 to prioritise all power lines in Hungary as to the urgency of bird-friendly conversion. The total length of top priority power lines is 21,700 km. Based on this figure, the funding needed to convert all top priority power lines is in the order of 60 million euros. The plan is to eliminate most of this threat by 2020. Under the agreement, and based on regular consultations with all partners concerned, distribution companies have also prepared and constantly update BAT (best available technology) for the creation of bird-friendly power lines where new power lines are set up. The BAT documentation is available in Hungarian. BirdLife Hungary has set up a national database of all observed bird casualties and runs yearly surveys to monitor certain power lines. The Act on Nature Conservation No. 53 of 1996 was also amended in December 2008 to only allow bird-friendly technologies at new or fully renewed power lines. Locations of particular importance to birds are carefully considered in the planning phase, especially since Hungary’s accession to the European Union, as the requirement of an appropriate assessment is compulsory also in Special Protection Areas under the Birds Directive.

No information on phosphorus concentrations in rivers was available.','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

This represents an increase of 0.08 since 1999, but an overall decrease of 0.08 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','Data above is for Netherlands EEZ, not including Overseas Territories.From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication.

Increasing the selectivity of the most common trap gear in use by installing selective sieves or increasing the mesh size in the last chamber to 20 mm (mesh size).Catch limits on recreational fishing to 2 eel per day. National regulations do not take into consideration daily recreational catches. This will counteract increasing mortality caused by recreational fishing that is above the level used in the population model.Limiting predatory pressure of black cormorants.

	('Poland',3,'Objective3','MeanTrophic','The mean marine trophic level for Polish EEZ in 2004 was 3.27. This represents a decrease of 0.02 since 1999 and a decrease of 0.43 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down. ','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Os valores de percentagens identificados na tabela acima têm em consideração o conjunto das áreas designadas no âmbito das Directivas Aves e Habitats, ou seja, um total de 155 áreas classificadas. No que respeita à gestão dos SIC e ZPE na área continental de Portugal, o Plano Sectorial da Rede Natura 2000 (PSRN2000), aprovado pela Resolução do Conselho de Ministros n.º 115-A/2008, de 21 de Julho, identifica um conjunto de linhas estratégicas a adoptar, conforme a seguir se enunciam: (1) Integração dos objectivos de conservação dos valores naturais nos instrumentos de gestão territorial, compatibilizando estes objectivos com um leque alargado de actividades, incluindo a urbanização, o turismo, a indústria extractiva, as infra-estruturas, as acessibilidades, o recreio e o lazer. Em conformidade com esta linha estratégica, os Planos de Ordenamento das Áreas Protegidas que incidem sobre cerca de 680 000 ha de área classificada no âmbito da Rede Natura, regulamentam os usos e ocupações de solo em função das exigências ecológicas dos diferentes valores naturais da área por eles abrangida, acautelando ao nível do ordenamento espacial e gestão os eventuais impactes desfavoráveis que os actos, acções e ou actividades possam gerar sobre o património natural. Desta forma, nos SIC ou ZPE coincidentes, no seu todo ou em parte, com os limites de áreas protegidas classificadas no âmbito da Rede Nacional de Áreas Protegidas (RNAP), os objectivos de conservação e de gestão identificados pelo PSRN2000 são proporcionalmente assegurados através dos planos de ordenamento das áreas protegidas, correspondendo a 34% dos 1 980 253 ha classificados como Rede Natura 2000 em Portugal continental, sob gestão directa do Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade (ICNB)). Apesar do âmbito geográfico destes planos não abranger a totalidade das áreas classificadas como SIC ou ZPE mas apenas as áreas que são cumulativamente classificadas no âmbito da RNAP e Rede Natura 2000, existem outros mecanismos legais (por exemplo avaliação de impacte ambiental e avaliação ambiental estratégica), e de planeamento e ordenamento orientados para prevenir a destruição, degradação ou perturbação dos valores naturais. No remanescente do território classificado como Rede Natura 2000, não abrangido por áreas protegidas, os Planos Directores Municipais assumem um papel fundamental ao nível do ordenamento do território. A revisão destes planos, a efectivar até 2014 face às orientações estratégicas determinadas pelo PSRN2000, tem vindo a ser acompanhada pelo ICNB, no sentido de garantir a adopção das melhores opções de ordenamento com vista ao objectivo global de proteger ou manter num estado de conservação favorável os valores naturais protegidos que motivaram a classificação dos territórios por eles abrangidos. Interessa ainda referir a integração do PSRN2000 nas diferentes políticas sectoriais, já efectivada, designadamente, nas políticas de desenvolvimento regional, florestal e também na política de ordenamento do litoral. Os Planos Regionais de Ordenamento Florestal constituem um primeiro passo para a concretização dessa política, tendo a sua elaboração considerado as orientações estratégicas determinadas pelo PSRN2000 para as áreas da Rede Natura 2000. A totalidade da Rede Natura 2000 é abrangida por estes planos regionais, que traçam o quadro de referência do desenvolvimento florestal, a operacionalizar através dos planos de gestão florestal a desenvolver a uma escala mais detalhada. Quando em áreas classificadas incluem um programa de gestão da biodiversidade, conforme estabelecido pelo regime jurídico dos instrumentos de gestão florestal. Ao nível do litoral encontram-se concluídos os planos de ordenamento da orla costeira para a totalidade do território alvo, constituindo-se como o principal instrumento operacional para o ordenamento do espaço (onde se inclui uma faixa marítima de protecção) na prossecução dos objectivos de protecção da integridade biofísica das áreas abrangidas, de valorização dos recursos existentes e de conservação dos valores ambientais e paisagísticos. (2) Promoção de uma gestão activa para a conservação dos SIC e ZPE, assente maioritariamente no estabelecimento de parcerias nos sectores agrícola, florestal e de pastorícia, na medida em que a manutenção num estado favorável de conservação de grande parte dos valores naturais que estão na origem da designação da Rede Natura 2000, são estreitamente dependentes deste tipo de actividades. Identifica-se como medida fundamental a disponibilização dos meios necessários à sua execução, integrando os objectivos de conservação da biodiversidade nas políticas agrícola e de desenvolvimento rural e das pescas. Deste modo, em SIC e ZPE cujos objectivos de conservação estão dependentes de uma gestão orientada para a manutenção ou fomento de determinadas práticas de natureza florestal, agrícola e pecuária, a elaboração de Intervenções Territoriais Integradas (ITI), no contexto do Plano de Desenvolvimento Rural – Continente (2008-2013), constitui a solução mais adequada e estruturante, assente num conjunto de medidas de natureza agro- e silvo-ambiental. Foi com o objectivo de identificar as possibilidades de integração de medidas necessárias à gestão das áreas classificadas da Rede Natura 2000 (Portugal continental) na programação da política de desenvolvimento rural a consubstanciar no PRODER, que o ICNB apresentou o relatório “Estudo sobre a Integração da Gestão da Rede Natura 2000 na Estratégia Nacional de Desenvolvimento Rural 2007-2013”, de carácter estratégico, para a gestão agrícola e florestal na Rede Natura 2000, a implementar no contexto da programação da política de desenvolvimento rural, que se encontra agora em plena fase de execução. É demonstrada a relevância e dependência da gestão agrícola e florestal para o sucesso da Rede Natura 2000, sendo que em 90% da superfície total da Rede existe um elevado grau de associação entre os valores naturais a conservar e o tipo de gestão agrícola e florestal praticada. Deste modo, em 2008 o Regulamento de Aplicação das Componentes Agro-Ambientais e Silvo-Ambientais da Medida n.º 2.4 «Intervenções Territoriais Integradas», do Subprograma n.º 2 do Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural do Continente (PRODER) aprovado pela Portaria nº 232-A/2008, constitui assim a 1ª Fase de ITI, que abrange 8 Intervenções Territoriais Integradas abrangendo 37% da área de Rede Natura 2000: (ITI) Peneda-Gerês, ITI Montesinho-Nogueira, ITI Douro Internacional, ITI Serra da Estrela, ITI Tejo Internacional, ITI Serras de Aire e Candeeiros, ITI Castro Verde e ITI Costa Sudoeste, abrangendo já.  Tendo por base o desenvolvimento conceptual anterior, foi concluída pelo ICNB em 2008 a preparação de um conjunto de Medidas de Gestão Agrícola e Florestal para as áreas classificadas da Rede Natura 2000 a incluir numa 2ª Fase de ITI, conforme previsto na programação da política de desenvolvimento rural para o período 2007-13.Tendo em conta os valores naturais, os principais factores de ameaça e as orientações de gestão relacionadas com a actividade agrícola e florestal identificados no PSRN2000 e fontes bibliográficas complementares, definiu-se o universo dos objectivos de conservação a atingir através das medidas a incluir nas ITI. Estes objectivos foram definidos tomando também em consideração os impactos potenciais da evolução agrícola e florestal de acordo com as principais tendências identificadas nos territórios em análise no horizonte temporal até 2013.Os objectivos de conservação identificados para cada ITI conjugados com os resultados das dinâmicas agro-florestais destes territórios, permitiram conceber as medidas necessárias à gestão dos valores naturais que estão na base da designação das áreas classificadas abrangidas por estas ITI (incluindo condições de acesso, compromissos e níveis de pagamento).O desenvolvimento destas medidas envolveu a aferição da sua aceitação e adequação às características e condições concretas das explorações agrícolas/florestais a que se dirigem, junto de agricultores e outros potenciais beneficiários. Procurou-se, deste modo, assegurar uma boa adesão às medidas, factor essencial para que os objectivos de conservação pretendidos possam ser, de facto, alcançados.Os resultados deste estudo são uma base técnica sólida para o desenvolvimento das ITI em referência, em articulação com a Autoridade de Gestão do PRODER, as entidades relevantes do Ministério da Agricultura, do Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas e com os parceiros relevantes, em particular as associações representativas dos agricultores, produtores florestais, entidades gestoras da caça, proprietários e organizações não governamentais de ambiente. O processo encontra-se actualmente em discussão e negociação tendo em vista o estabelecimento do novo pacote de ITI (2ª fase) em 2010. O reforço dos apoios destinados à Rede Natura 2000 previsto no PRODER será assim utilizado para assegurar o alargamento do instrumento ITI a todas as demais áreas classificadas para cujos objectivos de conservação é relevante uma gestão agro-florestal dirigida.(3) Enquadrar e promover a gestão dos valores associados às linhas de água e aos sistemas húmidos em estreita articulação entre as autoridades de conservação da biodiversidade e as entidades de tutela da gestão da água, designadamente através da implementação da Lei Quadro da Água, numa lógica de gestão integrada da bacia hidrográfica. Encontra-se assim prevista a intervenção das autoridades de conservação da biodiversidade na elaboração dos planos de bacia, e de ordenamento dos estuários, lagoas e albufeiras;(4) Elaborar planos de gestão que definam as medidas e acções de conservação, visando a compatibilização da conservação dos valores naturais com as actividades praticadas em Rede Natura 2000,se necessário, em face de uma avaliação dos instrumentos e mecanismos já existentes .A nível da integração da biodiversidade noutras políticas e actividades, merecem relevo os esforços dirigidos para o conhecimento e minimização dos impactes directos das infra-estruturas lineares nos valores naturais, sobretudo ao nível dos impactes na conectividade ecológica e na fragmentação que estas impõem ao território. Refiram-se a este propósito, os protocolos de colaboração estabelecidos entre as empresas de transporte e distribuição de energia eléctrica, o ICNB e ONGA, iniciados em 2003, e ao abrigo dos quais se desenvolveu um trabalho pioneiro de caracterização da situação actual dos impactes das linhas de transporte e de distribuição de energia eléctrica na avifauna e de compatibilização das linhas eléctricas com as protecção da avifauna, monitorizando a eficácia das medidas de correcção introduzidas, testando novas tipologias das estruturas minimizadoras dos impactos e de implementação de operações de correcção de linhas identificadas como perigosas para a avifauna. Foram ainda elaborados guias de análise de projectos, nomeadamente de projectos de instalação de linhas aéreas de distribuição e transporte de energia eléctrica, e de estradas e vias de comunicação, tendo em vista uniformizar as soluções propostas em sede de Avaliação de Incidências Ambientais ou em processos de licenciamento e garantir a eficácia destas soluções.Actividades passíveis de gerar impacte negativo sobre os SIC ou ZPE foram objecto de regulamentação e ou de legislação específica e de integração em outras políticas sectoriais:- Actividade cinegética: Como resultados mais relevantes ao nível deste sector, realça-se a promoção do ordenamento cinegético em todo o território nacional, implementando modelos de gestão sustentável para as espécies cinegéticas. Este objectivo, destinado a terminar com o regime cinegético não ordenado, foi bem sucedido, existindo actualmente nesta situação apenas cerca de 10% dos terrenos cinegéticos. Este novo regime permitiu ainda integrar na legislação cinegética procedimentos que contemplam a especificidade das áreas classificadas e respectivos valores naturais a preservar, designadamente ao nível da aprovação das zonas de caça e dos respectivos planos de ordenamento e gestão cinegética. Refira-se a título indicativo que a autoridade nacional de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade (ICNB) apoia e acompanha actualmente a gestão de cerca de 33% do total de Zonas de Caça existentes a nível nacional, correspondendo aproximadamente a 1300 Zonas de Caça. Ainda no mesmo âmbito, refira-se que os planos de ordenamento das áreas protegidas integram igualmente disposições destinadas a regular o exercício da caça nas mesmas.- Actividade florestal: Relativamente a esta actividade e constituindo igualmente um documento de carácter normativo, foi elaborado um “Manual de apoio à emissão de pareceres de âmbito florestal”, cujo conteúdo permite ainda orientar a elaboração de projectos florestais e a decisão face ao valor ecológico das áreas por eles abrangidas. - Pesca: A legislação que regulamenta esta actividade define, entre outros aspectos, para as espécies piscícolas os métodos de pesca interditos, a dimensão da malha no caso do uso de redes, os períodos de defeso, as dimensões mínimas dos espécimes a capturar, o método para a manutenção de exemplares vivos de qualquer dimensão durante uma competição, para devolução ao meio natural. - Observação de cetáceos: Foi regulamentada a actividade de observação de cetáceos nas águas de Portugal continental (Dec. Lei n.º 9/2006 de 6 de Janeiro). - Espécies não indígenas da fauna e flora: Encontra-se regulamentada desde 1999 a sua introdução na natureza (Dec. Lei n.º 565/99 de 21 de Dezembro), neste momento em fase de revisão.Na Região Autónoma da Madeira encontram-se já elaborados e publicados Planos e Programas de Medidas que abrangem a totalidade de SIC desta Região e as ZPE, na medida em que os limites por elas abrangidos são idênticos aos SIC correspondentes, sendo que a totalidade dos SIC e ZPE designados na Região Autónoma dos Açores se encontram munidos de planos de gestão desde 2004. ','','O ordenamento do território é reconhecidamente um instrumento fundamental para a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade, na medida em que disciplina a ocupação do espaço atendendo à distribuição geográfica dos valores naturais de modo a compatibilizar a sua salvaguarda, bem como a protecção da paisagem. A integração dos princípios de conservação e utilização sustentável da natureza e da biodiversidade nas políticas de ordenamento do território é efectivada, em particular, através de Instrumentos de Gestão Territorial (IGT).Os instrumentos de gestão territorial aplicáveis aos SIC e ZPE devem assim garantir a conservação dos habitats e das populações das espécies em função dos quais as referidas zonas foram classificadas. No sentido de concretizar estes objectivos, o Plano Sectorial da Rede Natura 2000 (PSRN2000), instrumento de concretização da política nacional de conservação da diversidade biológica, visa a salvaguarda e valorização integrada de áreas classificadas como SIC e ZPE, bem como a manutenção das espécies e habitats num estado de conservação favorável nestas áreas, identificando um conjunto de orientações de gestão estratégicas por área classificada a integrar nos instrumentos de gestão territorial (planos municipais de ordenamento do território/PMOT e nos planos especiais de ordenamento do território /PEOT) aplicáveis ao território do continente, no prazo máximo de seis anos após a sua aprovação. Nesta medida, a aplicação das orientações de gestão e das outras normas programáticas estabelecidas no PSRN2000 são da responsabilidade da administração central e local, a garantir por diversos instrumentos e mecanismos, sejam eles pela (1) criação ou revisão do quadro legislativo, (2) revisão ou alteração de outros instrumentos de gestão territorial, nomeadamente planos municipais, planos especiais de ordenamento do território e planos de génese sectorial ou regional, (3) elaboração de Planos de Gestão territoriais, (4) elaboração de Planos de Acção orientados para espécies ou habitats, (5) integração e orientação de medidas programáticas ou de política sectorial tais como, e a título de exemplo, as enquadradas no Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural Continente (2008-2013), na política da água ou de transportes ou nas políticas costeira e marinha, (6) elaboração de acordos, parcerias ou medidas contratuais (com actores públicos ou privados) e ainda através do estabelecimento de medidas de carácter administrativo.Transitoriamente e enquanto não se concretiza, na totalidade, a integração do PSRN2000, seja através da elaboração e/ou revisão dos diversos instrumentos de gestão territorial, seja através da adopção de outros mecanismos por ele previstos, em áreas de SIC e ZPE e em face dos resultados de uma avaliação prévia dos eventuais impactes negativos que possam ser resultantes da sua concretização, são sujeitos a autorização prévia por parte do ICNB enquanto autoridade de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade, as seguintes acções, actos e actividades: - A realização de obras de construção civil fora dos perímetros urbanos- A alteração do uso actual do solo que abranja áreas contínuas superiores a 5 ha- As modificações de coberto vegetal resultantes da alteração entre tipos de uso agrícola e florestal, em áreas contínuas superiores a 5 ha - As alterações à morfologia do solo, com excepção das decorrentes das normais actividades agrícolas e florestais- A alteração do uso actual dos terrenos das zonas húmidas ou marinhas- A deposição de sucatas e de resíduos sólidos e líquidos- A abertura de novas vias de comunicação - A instalação de infra-estruturas de electricidade, telefónicas, telecomunicações, transporte de gás natural ou de outros combustíveis, saneamento básico e aproveitamento de energias renováveis ou similares fora dos perímetros urbanos- A prática de actividades motorizadas organizadas e competições desportivas fora dos perímetros urbanos- A prática de alpinismo, de escalada e de montanhismo- A reintrodução de espécies indígenas da fauna e da flora selvagens Por outro lado, a decisão sobre acções, planos ou projectos não directamente relacionados com a gestão de um SIC ou de uma ZPE e não necessários para essa gestão, mas susceptíveis de afectar essa zona de forma significativa, individualmente ou em conjugação com outras acções, planos ou projectos, está dependente das conclusões de um processo de avaliação de incidências ambientais no que se refere aos objectivos de conservação da referida zona, avaliação essa que pode assumir a figura de AIA (Avaliação de Impacte Ambiental) ou AincA (Análise de Incidências Ambientais).A totalidade do número de sítios Rede Natura 2000 designados em Portugal continental encontra-se sob gestão do ICNB.São também aplicáveis outros instrumentos de gestão e ordenamento à totalidade de sítios Rede Natura 2000 do continente.','Reference or title:Weblink:Plano Sectorial da Rede Natura 2000 – Resolução do Conselho de Ministros n.º 115-A/2008 de 21 de Julho  Estudo sobre a Integração da Gestão da Rede Natura 2000 na Estratégia Nacional de Desenvolvimento Rural 2007-2013 http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Ordenamento+e+Gestão/Plano+Sectorial+da+Rede+Natura+2000/http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Ordenamento+e+Gestão/Planos+de+Ordenamento+das+Áreas+Protegidas+%28POAP%29/http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Ordenamento+e+Gestão/Planos+de+Ordenamento+da+Orla+Costeira+%28POOC%29/http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Ordenamento+e+Gestão/Infra-estruturas+Lineares+-+Manuais+de+Apoio/http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Ordenamento+e+Gestão/Ordenamento+e+Gestão+Cinegética/http://www.horta.uac.pt/projectos/macmar/life/index.html http://www.horta.uac.pt/projectos/macmar/ogamp/ogamp.html http://www.horta.uac.pt/projectos/macmar/ogamp/index.html http://www.spea.pt/ms_priolo/pt/index.php?op=plano_gestao;http://www.dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2008/07/13901/0000200451.PDFhttp://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT2007/O+ICNB/Rede+Natura+2000/Medidas+Rede+Natura+2000+PRODER.htm','21/04/2010','','','13/05/2010',''),

Consolida a natureza jurídica da Rede Fundamental de Conservação da Natureza (RFCN – estabelecida pela Estratégia Nacional de Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade em 2001), a qual é composta pelas áreas nucleares de Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade integradas no Sistema Nacional de Áreas Classificadas (SNAC) e pelas áreas da Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN), da Reserva Agrícola Nacional (RAN) e do Domínio Público Hídrico (DPH), enquanto áreas que estabelecem ou salvaguardam a ligação e o intercâmbio genético de populações de espécies selvagens entre as diferentes áreas nucleares de conservação, contribuindo para uma adequada protecção dos recursos naturais e para a promoção da continuidade espacial, da coerência ecológica das áreas classificadas e da conectividade das componentes da biodiversidade em todo o território, bem como para uma adequada integração e desenvolvimento das actividades humanas.O Decreto-Lei n.º 140/99, de 24 de Abril (transpõe para o direito interno as Directivas Aves e Habitats), republicado pelo Decreto-Lei n.º 49/05, de 24 de Fevereiro, preconiza que os instrumentos das políticas de ordenamento do território e de desenvolvimento devem manter e, se possível, desenvolver os elementos paisagísticos de importância fundamental para a fauna e flora selvagens, tendo em vista a melhoria da coerência ecológica da Rede Natura 2000, incluindo através de incentivos à sua gestão adequada, considerando-se elementos paisagísticos de importância fundamental para a fauna e a flora selvagens os elementos que, pela sua estrutura linear e contínua, como os rios, ribeiras e respectivas margens ou os sistemas tradicionais de delimitação dos campos, ou pelo seu papel de espaço de ligação, como os lagos, lagoas ou matas, são essenciais à migração, à distribuição geográfica e ao intercâmbio genético de espécies selvagens.O desenvolvimento e concretização destes objectivos, a promover nos Instrumentos de Gestão Territorial (IGT) de acordo com o Decreto-Lei nº. 46/2009, de 20 de Fevereiroatravés da identificação da estrutura ecológica (integrando as áreas, valores e sistemas fundamentais para a protecção e valorização ambiental dos espaços rurais e urbanos), foi já consubstanciada no Programa Nacional da Política de Ordenamento do Território (PNPOT) e nosplanos regionais (através da definição da Estrutura Regional de Protecção e Valorização Ambiental (ERPVA) que inclui as áreas e as ligações ecológicas fundamentais ao nível das respectivas Regiões). Embora a escalas distintas, os planos intermunicipais de ordenamento do território e os planos sectoriais relevantes definirão os princípios, as directrizes e as medidas de forma a concretizar as orientações políticas relativas às áreas de protecção e valorização ambiental que garantam a salvaguarda dos ecossistemas e a intensificação dos processos biofísicos.Tendo por base o enquadramento acima, a autoridade de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade assegurou a sua representação no contexto da elaboração dos IGT (PROF, PROT e PDM), fornecendo a informação necessária à definição e salvaguarda de corredores ecológicos, com base, designadamente, nas orientações estratégicas constantes do PSRN2000.No caso particular dos territórios insulares, a Região Autónoma dos Açores (RAA) atendendo à diversidade de situações resultantes da implementação da Rede Natura 2000 e à necessidade de adoptar um modelo assente em critérios de gestão que uniformizem a diversidade de designações das áreas classificadas como protegidas e concentrem competências numa unidade territorial de ilha enquanto unidade base de gestão, procedeu a uma reformulação do regime jurídico da classificação, gestão e administração das Áreas Protegidas (Decreto Legislativo Regional n.º 15/2007/A, de 25 de Junho). Este Diploma contempla Áreas nucleares de conservação da natureza que correspondem às áreas mais importantes sob o ponto de vista da conservação e da biodiversidade de recursos e Áreas ecológicas complementares, que correspondem às principais estruturas biofísicas presentes no território que permitem assegurar a continuidade dos processos ecológicos entre as áreas nucleares e os territórios mais interiores e litorais, assumindo especial relevo o sistema hídrico nas suas componentes superficial e subterrânea;Os Parques Naturais de Ilha (actualmente 6 já publicados e 3 em fase de publicação) e o Parque Marinho do Arquipélago dos Açores, obrigatoriamente, dotados de um plano de ordenamento com a natureza de plano especial de ordenamento do território, constituem a unidade de gestão de base da Rede Regional de Áreas Protegidas da RAA. Por outro lado, tendo em vista a adequação legal da REN às especificidades desta Região, será criada e delimitada a Reserva Ecológica Regional (RER) contribuindo para o desenvolvimento sustentável dos seus valores e recursos endógenos.Na RAA, já após a fase de participação pública, encontra-se em 2010 na Assembleia Legislativa da Região Autónoma dos Açores a aguardar aprovação, a proposta do Plano Regional de Ordenamento do Território para a Região (PROTA), onde, entre outras, estão contempladas as Áreas ecológicas complementares, que correspondem às principais estruturas biofísicas presentes no território que permitem assegurar a continuidade dos processos ecológicos entre as áreas nucleares e entre os territórios mais interiores e litorais.A Região Autónoma da Madeira, aquando do delineamento e criação das suas áreas protegidas, sejam elas Parque Natural da Madeira (PNM), Reservas Naturais Parciais e Integrais, ou ainda Sítios de Importância Comunitária, procurou que estes incluíssem todos os habitats, flora e fauna de importância biológica. Estas áreas protegidas encontram-se desde o litoral (englobando zonas com elevada densidade demográfica) até ao interior das ilhas (onde ocorrem as áreas de floresta Laurissilva e os maciços montanhosos). Os Parques e reservas criados possuem um papel importante na protecção da biodiversidade e dos ecossistemas, garantido a conectividade ecológica, uma vez que os 49.443 ha de área total protegida da RAM permitem o fluxo de fauna e flora através de corredores ecológicos que facilitam a ligação entre o litoral o interior das ilhas, contribuindo igualmente para a preservação de recursos naturais essenciais.','','Refira-se a Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN) que visa contribuir para a ocupação e o uso sustentáveis do território, constituindo um contributo fundamental para a conectividade e a coerência ecológica da RFCN e para a sua integração nos Planos Directores Municipais (PDM), na medida em que tratando-se de uma restrição de utilidade pública a que se aplica um regime territorial especial, estabelece condicionamentos à ocupação, uso e transformação do solo, identificando também os usos e as acções compatíveis com os objectivos desse regime para os vários tipos de áreas que a integram e que prevalece sobre os regimes de uso, ocupação e transformação do solo estabelecidos em Planos Municipais de Ordenamento do Território, que vinculam particulares. Ao nível sectorial importa destacar a figura dos Planos Regionais de Ordenamento Florestal (PROF), que estabelecem um conceito de «Corredor ecológico» enquanto faixas que promovem a conexão entre áreas florestais dispersas, favorecendo o intercâmbio genético, essencial para a manutenção da biodiversidade. Estes corredores devem ser objecto de tratamento específico no âmbito dos Planos de Gestão Florestal (PGF), servindo para consubstanciar as diversas redes e estruturas ecológicas. Assim, cada PROF define a sua componente da rede nacional de corredores ecológicos florestais e um conjunto de orientações para a delimitação, em cada região e por cada plano de gestão florestal, a aplicar às unidades de gestão, das áreas destinadas à função de conservação de habitats, da fauna e da flora, ou seja a contribuição dos espaços florestais para a manutenção da diversidade biológica e genética. Englobam-se neste contexto as seguintes subfunções principais: a conservação de habitats classificados, a conservação de espécies da flora e da fauna protegida, a conservação de geomonumentos e a conservação dos recursos genéticos.    Considera-se em particular que: 1 - Os corredores ecológicos contribuem para a formação de meta-populações de comunidades da fauna e da flora, tendo como objectivo conectar populações, núcleos ou elementos isolados, e integram os principais eixos de conexão, delimitados na carta síntese de cada PROF, com a largura máxima de 3 km; 2 - As normas a aplicar no âmbito do planeamento florestal para os corredores ecológicos são as consideradas para as funções de protecção e de conservação, nomeadamente a subfunção de protecção da rede hidrográfica, com objectivos de gestão e intervenções florestais ao nível da condução e restauração de povoamentos nas galerias ripícolas, bem como a subfunção de conservação de recursos genéticos, com objectivos de gestão da manutenção da diversidade genética dos povoamentos florestais e manutenção e fomento dos próprios corredores ecológicos. 3 - Os corredores ecológicos devem contribuir para a definição da estrutura ecológica municipal no âmbito dos PMOT e ser objecto de tratamento específico no âmbito dos planos de gestão florestal aplicados às unidades de gestão, públicas ou privadas. 4 - Estes corredores devem ser compatibilizados com as redes regionais de defesa da floresta contra os incêndios, sendo estas de carácter prioritário.  A um nível de maior detalhe, destaca-se a implementação da figura de reservas de caça (locais onde não se caça) enquanto contributo para a concretização da conectividade ecológica, com vista à salvaguarda dos principais corredores migratórios de forma a permitir manter os fluxos populacionais das espécies, cinegéticas ou não, nas suas migrações. Acresce a interdição de caçar nos principais locais de concentração de efectivos migratórios, de modo a garantir a tranquilidade necessária ao sucesso desta estratégia comportamental.','Regime Jurídico da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade Regime Jurídico da Reserva Ecológica Nacional; Planos Regionais de Ordenamento Florestal; http://www.dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2008/07/14200/0459604611.PDF; http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2008/08/16200/0586505884.PDF; http://www.afn.min-agricultura.pt/portal/gestao-florestal/; http://www.azores.gov.pt/','21/04/2010','','','13/05/2010',''),

Percentages have been calculated based on figures on actual agri-environment payments taken from 2007 and 2008 monitoring data provided under A2.1.1.Further details are provided in Portuguese but not English.A Estratégia Nacional de Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade determina o objectivo de prosseguir, sob a coordenação das autoridades nacionais de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas, o desenvolvimento de acções de conservação in situ e ex situ dos recursos genéticos agrícolas e aquícolas, nomeadamente das espécies e variedades vegetais e das raças autóctones, bem como dos ecossistemas em que os mesmos se tenham desenvolvido.Em relação ao processo de selecção das espécies e dos povoamentos florestais a serem certificados para comercialização, as regras de produção com vista à comercialização e a comercialização de material de reprodução florestal na Comunidade estão estabelecidas pela Directiva 1999/105/EC, de 22 de Dezembro de 1999, que foi transposta para o direito nacional pelo Decreto-Lei n.º 205/2003, de 12 de Setembro. Apenas as espécies florestais com valor para florestação na Comunidade foram consideradas. A Autoridade Florestal Nacional mantém uma base de dados de árvores autóctones e não autóctones, escolhidas segundo os critérios da Directiva 1999/105/CE. Portugal é um importante reservatório de recursos genéticos animais, estando oficialmente reconhecidas 45 Raças Autóctones, sendo 15 raças da espécie Bovina, 15 raças de Ovinos, 5 raças de Caprinos, 3 raças de Suínos, 4 raças de Equídeos e 3 raças de Galináceos. O financiamento nacional visando o apoio às raças locais/autóctones, desenvolve-se em duas vertentes constantes do Plano de Desenvolvimento Rural (2007 - 2013) para o Continente: •	Financiamento directamente aos Agricultores, subvencionando a manutenção ”in-situ” dos efectivos autóctones (Acção 2.2.2. Protecção da Biodiversidade Doméstica);•	Financiamento às Associações de Criadores detentoras da gestão de Livros Genealógicos/Registos Zootécnicos, visando suportar os custos com o seu funcionamento (preservação) e os custos com as acções de melhoramento animal (Acção 2.2.3. Conservação e Melhoramento de Recursos Genéticos).Através destas medidas, no âmbito da manutenção e melhoramento genético de raças autóctones são apoiadas 34 Associações de criadores de Raças Autóctones. As estruturas apoiadas são detentoras dos Livros Genealógicos e são responsáveis pela operacionalização dum Programa de Conservação ou Melhoramento Genético plurianual.Com o objectivo de preservar a raça bovina Ramo Grande é autóctone da Região Autónoma dos Açores, e após definido o respectivo padrão, foi estabelecido em 1996 o seu Registo Zootécnico. No âmbito do PRORURAL foram criadas medidas visando a preservação do património genético animal e cultural através da manutenção da raça bovina autóctone Ramo Grande e das práticas culturais associadas.No âmbito do PRORURAL é ainda contemplada a Conservação de Pomares Tradicionais dos Açores com os seguintes objectivos: preservação do património genético vegetal, através da conservação de espécies tradicionais; Potenciação de actividades alternativas; Manutenção de paisagens rurais de elevado valor natural e Preservação da paisagem tradicional.Portugal participou no projecto “European Crop Wild Relative Diversity Assessment and Conservation Forum” (2002-2005), financiado pelo Quinto Programa Quadro da UE. O projecto pretendeu estabelecer as condições necessárias à conservação a longo prazo e sensibilizar para a necessidade de incrementar a utilização dos recursos genéticos vegetais na Europa.No âmbito dos Regulamentos do Conselho Europeu (EC) Nº 1467/94 e Nº 870/2004, dirigidos para a conservação de recursos genéticos vegetais, Portugal participa em projectos de conservação de recursos genéticos de diversas espécies de interesse agrícola (meloeiro, videira, couve, milho e arroz), e ainda no projecto AEGRO que tem por objectivo o estabelecimento de princípios gerais de gestão in situ (nas reservas genéticas e no campo dos agricultores) dos recursos genéticos vegetais. A vinha é importante por todo o país, onde 340 variedades são oficialmente autorizadas para produção de vinho. Para além destas, outras 10 são importantes como uvas de mesa. Durante a década de 90 foi estabelecida uma colecção nacional orientada para a conservação das variedades. De forma a manter a variabilidade genética (variabilidade dos clones) foram estabelecidas no campo outras 70 colecções.A oliveira é cultivada em 9% da área agrícola (INE, 2008), incluindo várias variedades autóctones, caso da Galega e Cordovil de Serpa. Algumas grandes prorpiedades no Alentejo e no Ribatejo possuem programas de conservação das variedades tradicionais portuguesas.Existe ainda uma grande diversidade de variedades autóctones de maçãs e pêras, sobretudo nas áreas rurais do norte de Portugal, sendo as variedades mais protegidas as com alto valor comercial. Mais de uma centena de variedades tradicionais de fruteiras foram inventariadas, nomeadamente pereira, macieira, figueira, cerejeira, amendoeira, castanheiro e alfarrobeira.Têm vindo a ser realizados desenvolvidos inventários de variedades tradicionais, por exemplo de fruteiras, feijão, centeio e milho, e de plantas medicinais e aromáticas, incluindo conhecimento tradicional associado.Também nas Regiões Autónomas dos Açores e da Madeira foi realizado um inventário das cultivares tradicionais. A ONG “Colher para Semear Rede Portuguesa de Variedades Tradicionais” criada em Março de 2006, está orientada opara a inventariação e conservação das cultivares tradicionais.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

The ENGIZC reaffirms the national objectives currently implemented in the present legal framework, reinforcing the need for integrated coastal zone management and the need for coordinated planning and management of maritime area and marine conservation. Fulfilling the EU guidelines, the ENGIZC sets out a vision for a period of 20 years, with the potential for re-evaluation and revision if required, ensuring a long term and strategic approach. The vision embraces principles defined in the document \"Principles for the integrated management of national coastal zone”, which incorporate the guidelines and values reflected in the national territorial management instruments: sustainability and intergenerational solidarity, cohesion and social equity, prevention and precaution; systemic approach, scientific and technical knowledge, subsidiarity, participation, shared responsibility, operability. Considering the framework adopted and the vision and principles laid down, a set of policy options was established, consistent with the results of strategic environmental assessment. In the Azores Autonomous Region there are six approved coastal plans. These focus on the coastal and inland waters, seabeds and banks, with boundaries set within each plan, specifically the \"terrestrial protection zone\", with a maximum width of 500m from the high tide level, and the \"maritime protection zone”, up to the 30m isobath. In the Autonomous Region of Madeira four coastal spatial plans are being drafted in Funchal - Ponta de S. Lawrence, Câmara de Lobos - Ponta do Pargo, North Coast and Porto Santo.

In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 of 18 September, Member states are required to develop eel management plans tailored to regional and local conditions. Portugal created aninterministerial working group to prepare the Eel Management Plan (EMP). The first version of the plan was provided at the request of the European Commission in May 2009 with a view to its consideration by ICES. It was then reviewed in October 2009, following the ICES assessment, and is currently pending the Commission\'s final decision. Following approval of the plan implementation of the plan will begin. The sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) was considered \"Regionally Extinct\" in Portugal and it has not been caught in the country since the early 1980s (Almaça & Elvira, 2000). In relation to actions to remove barriers to fish migration, a survey was carried out of these barriers with a detailed characterisation of the type of obstacles. A methodology for assessing the existing arrangements for fish passes was developed (Santo, M, 2005). In order to increase populations of migratory species, the following activities should be noted: • The ex-situ conservation of Lampetra fluviatilis, to provide a genetic repository for restocking areas;• Restocking of Petromyzon marinus under the recovery plan for the migratory fish community of the River Douro basin. Under the extension of Natura 2000 in the marine environment, the enlargement of already-designated Natura 2000 sites are planned, to include the mouths of several rivers (Minho, Lima, Vouga, Ancora, Mira and Guadiana). This will allow greater protection for diadromous fish species, through better management of barriers and the consequent increase in continuity needed for migration.

Shark monitoring The monitoring program for deep-sea sharks has been in place since 2003 and since 2005 for surface sharks, based in the Department of Fisheries Resources, Institute of Fisheries and Marine Research (IPIMAR) and is expected to continue until 2013. Monthly sampling is carried out of landings of two of the most important species of deep sea shark: Centroscymnus coelolepis and Centrophorus squamosus. Data on the landings of the Portuguese commercial long-line vessels operating off Sesimbra (center of mainland Portugal) are routinely collected. The information collected for each specimen includes the total length (TL in cm), total weight (TW kg), gonad weight (GW g), sex and stage of sexual maturity. Additionally in females, information on the width of the uterus (mm), oviducal gland size (mm), and the number and diameter of mature, immature and degenerate oocytes are also collected. The amount and length of embryos, when present in the uterus, are also recorded. The same information is collected for surface sharks: Prionace glauca and Isurus oxyrhynchus. Additional information on discards is also collected, including other species in accordance with Decision 2010/93/UE. In the Autonomous Region of Madeira monitoring of sharks is partially carried out under the National Fisheries Data Collection programme. Data on fisheries by-catch – supplemented with those from surveys at auctions – allows a partial idea of the fitness of this group of fauna. Pelagic sharks are also monitored through a project to monitor the sport fishing fleet, which includes observers on fishing vessels. Related projects in Madeira include: Project: ‘Deepwater Fisheries Resources of the Eastern Central Atlantic (PESCPROF - 1 and 2)’ monitors communities of cartilaginous fish, particularly shark species in the archipelago of Madeira. Data from these projects can be found at http://www.pescprof.org/. Project: PCT ‘MARPROF: Basis for the Management and Market Acceptability of Deep-water Species of Macaronesia’, aims at understanding the biology of these species and monitors deep-sea sharks using research cruises. Project: ‘Visual Censuses of coastal fish in the Madeira Archipelago’ in collaboration with the APEC (Portuguese Association for the Study and Conservation of Elasmobranchs), monitors all cartilaginous fishes, including rays and sharks. Seabird monitoring For seabirds, the following projects for mainland Portugal are worth mentioning: - Marine Censuses I: since 2004, beginning within the project LIFE-Nature Marine IBAs, censuses have been conducted aboard marine vessels. Despite the end of the project in 2008, censuses have continued regularly, with one or two annual campaigns, lasting about one month each. - Coastal Censuses I: since September 2008 coastal monitoring has been conducted off the Portuguese coast, between Cape Carvoeiro (Peniche) and Sagres, once or twice a month, following the methodology used in RAM (Marine birds and mammals monitoring network held throughout the Iberian coast). - During the winter 2008/09, the project Arenaria also took place, which allowed for the first time a complete census of the birds wintering in the Portuguese continental coast. This project could be replicated in future winters to compare inter-annual data. - Census (marine and coastal) II. Monitoring of seabirds in the coastal area of central Portugal: Since 2002, the NGO Portuguese Society of Wildlife, in cooperation with the University of Minho and University of Aveiro, has maintained a monitoring program for seabirds. This monitoring program collects data through: censuses from coastal high points; censuses from vessels during the summer period; monitoring of coastal strandings (dead and alive). This project also involves the collection and rehabilitation of injured seabirds; storage of tissue in a tissue bank of marine animals; assessment of exposure to pollutants (heavy metals and POPs); assessment of parasite load, trophic ecology, and evaluation of incidental catches. The purpose of this interdisciplinary monitoring program is to gain an understanding of the factors that influence the distribution / abundance of seabirds, and relate this information with aspects of animal health. The Azores Autonomous Region signed a cooperation protocol between the Regional Secretariat for the Environment and the Sea and the Sea Institute (IMAR) for the ‘integrated monitoring of priority species of seabirds in the Azores – Moniaves’. Of importance is the project INTERREG MARMAC (2006-2008) (Knowledge, Promotion and Enhancement for Sustainable Use of Marine Protected Areas of Macaronesia), co-funded by INTERREG III-B/FEDER and the Department of Environment and Marine and coordinated by the Centre of IMAR / Department of Oceanography and Fisheries, University of the Azores. Within this project the pelagic ecology of cagarros in the Azores archipelago was studied through satellite telemetry, oceanographic characterization of the feeding areas and population census of seabirds that nest in the archipelago. Other important projects related to seabirds in Madeira include: Project LIFE-Nature ‘Conservation of Zino\'s Petrel Pterodroma madeira’ (2001-2006), enabled the recovery of the entire habitat of Zino\'s Petrel which is endemic to the island of Madeira and was previously threatened with extinction (see Annex I of Birds Directive and Annex II of the Bern Convention.) More information http://www.pnm.pt/ Project ‘LIFE - SOS Freira do Bugio ‘(Pterodroma feae), since 2006, which intends to monitor the status of Pterodroma feae populations, as well as restoring the entire ecosystem of Bugio Island.

	('Portugal',3,'A3_6_3','Offshore','Portugal has 60 marine Natura 2000 sites based on the presence of certain habitats and species (see clarification below). However there are different ways of defining marine sites, and according to national sources Portugal has designated 27 marine Natura 2000 sites in territorial waters (<12nm) and three Natura 2000 offshore sites, making the total number of sites 30.A number of fisheries measures have been adopted or modified within 12 marine Natura 2000 sites in territorial waters. In Portugal: Within the Arrábida / Espinhel SCI, fishing with dredges and other trawl gear is prohibited in order to protect the phanerogams grasslands (Habitat 1110). In marine areas subject to full protection, fishing is totally forbidden, and areas of partial protection are closed to commercial fishing except fishing with traps, angling with jigging lines at distances not less than 200m from shore and recreational fishing in all its forms. However, this exception does not apply to the area of partial protection Portinho Arrábida. In the SPA Berlengas Islands, the following fishing activities are prohibited: - Commercial fishing from unregistered boats; - Trawling, fishing with gill nets and fishing by traps, and retention on board of such gears; - Manual commercial fishing, including molluscs and crustaceans, except the manual capture of pilado (Polybius henslowi) and the exploitation of the barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) and grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), regulated by specific legislation; In marine areas subject to type I partial protection the following are still prohibited: - Angling by longline gear in excess of 200 hooks per unit or where the opening of hooks is less than 9 mm. - Angling with longline gear deployed less than 50m from land, regardless of overall length of vessels; - Commercial fishing with seines or traps; In marine areas subject to type II partial protection fishing with longline gear with over 200 hooks per unit or where the opening of hooks is less than 9 mm is forbidden. Commercial fishing is prohibited in a large percentage of the North Coast SCI for vessels fishing both inshore and offshore.In the Southwest Coast SCI recreational fishing is regulated, with prohibited zones corresponding to ecologically important rocky areas which constitute important areas for spawning and juvenile growth; refuge; protection from predators; and food for countless marine species. Within this area, recreational fishing is restricted to four days a week; there is a time limit on the catch, closed seasons and a list of species that can be harvested. There is also a system of positive discrimination to give priority of harvesting to natives and residents. In areas of the marine environment, the implementation of aquaculture is subject to authorization. In the Azores, the Natura 2000 network has been integrated within the arrangements for Island Natural Parks, for which rules have been defined to acheive effective fisheries management in these locations. For example: In the Ilheus das Formigas and Dollabarat reef SAC integrated in the Natural Reserve of Ilheus das Formigas, fishing is prohibited except commercial fishing with hand line or pole and line targeting tuna which use the continuous monitoring system of fishing activities (MONICAP). This is subject to the prior binding opinion of the Regional Inspectorate of Fisheries. In the Caloura-Ponta da Galera SAC integrated in the Protected Area for the Management of habitats or species from the islet of Vila Franca do Campo, any type of fishing is forbidden, including recreational fishing and spear fishing. In the Monte da Guia SAC integrated in the Caldeirinhas Natural Reserve, fishing and spearfishing are prohibited. In the Morro de Castelo Branco SAC, integrated into the Protected Area for Resource Management of Castelo Branco and Ilheu de Baixo - Restinga, unregulated fishing activity is not permitted. In the Costa and Caldeirao Corvo SAC, integrated in the Protected Area for resource management of Costa do Corvo, bottom and surface longline fishing is forbidden, as well as explosives, chemical agents, trawls, seines and deep-water gill nets and vessels over 10 m length, except for live bait fishing for tuna and vocational training. Aquaculture activity, commercial fishing, tourism, sports and underwater fishing and shellfish harvesting are regulated. In the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in the Ilhas Desertas and Ilhas Selvagens SAC, special measures for fishery management were defined and enshrined in the Regional Legislative Decree. Decree-Law No. 458/71/M of 29 October (which establishes the creation of the Natural Reserve of the Ilhas Selvagens), in conjunction with the Regional Legislative Decree No. 9/95/M, of May 20 (lays the creation of the Ilhas Desertas Nature Reserve), define the limits of fishing within these marine Natura2000 sites.  In the case of Ilhas Desertas, fishing can be carried out only beyond the 100 meters isobath, and only north of Deserta Grande and Ilheu Chão.

This represents a decrease of 0.07 since 1999, but an overall increase of 0.27 since 1984.  ','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

	('Portugal',4,'A4_3','','A obrigatoriedade da consideração das redes ecológicas no planeamento é anterior a 2006. Desde 1999 que a lei nacional define o regime legal aplicável a instrumentos de gestão territorial, estabelecendo o conceito de estrutura ecológica ou rede ecológica, implicando que a revisão ou a publicação de novos planos de ordenamento devem identificar áreas, valores e sistemas cruciais para a protecção ambiental e para benificiação das paisagens rural e urbana. A tradução espacial deste conceito é, a nível sub-nacional, a definição de uma estrutura para proteger e beneficiar os valores ecológicos e a rede ecológica regional, que define e orienta a aplicação à escala local da rede ecológica local, estrutura que é definida e regulamentada por planos municipais de gestão territorial (através de diploma legal). Contudo, após 2006, foram aprovados diversos documentos enquadradores e legislação que reforçam o papel das “redes” e “corredores ecológicos” no planeamento, nomeadamente o Programa Nacional da Política de Ordenamento do Território (Lei n.º 58/2007, de 4 de Setembro), o Plano Sectorial da Rede Natura 2000 (Resolução do Conselho de Ministros n.º 115-A/2008, de 31 de Julho), o Regime Jurídico da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade (Dec.-Lei n.º 142/2008, de 24 de Julho), a alteração ao Regime Jurídico dos Instrumentos de Gestão Territorial (Dec.-Lei n.º 46/2009, de 20 de Fevereiro), alteração ao regime jurídico da Reserva Ecológica Nacional (Dec.-Lei n.º 166/2008, de 22 de Agosto), alteração ao regime jurídico da Reserva Agrícola Nacional (Dec.-Lei n.º 73/2009, de 31 de Março) e, ainda, a Avaliação Ambiental de Planos e Programas (Dec.-Lei n.º 232/2007, de 15 de Junho). O Decreto-Lei n.º 46/2009, de 20 de Fevereiro, revê e desenvolve as bases da política de ordenamento do território e de urbanismo adoptadas em 1999, definindo o regime de coordenação dos âmbitos nacional, regional e municipal do sistema de gestão territorial. Engloba também, o regime geral de uso do solo e o regime de elaboração, aprovação, execução e avaliação dos instrumentos de gestão territorial (IGT). Os IGT devem identificar a estrutura ecológica, designadamente as áreas de reserva ecológica. Os IGT devem obrigatoriamente identificar as condicionantes legais, sendo que as redes ecológicas compostas pelas áreas protegidas e pela reserva ecológica estão incorporadas nessas mesmas condicionantes.No contexto da rede ecológica a Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN) assume uma importância decisiva. Sendo uma das componentes da Rede Fundamental de Conservação da Natureza, favorece a conectividade entre as áreas nucleares de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade integradas no Sistema Nacional de Áreas Classificadas. Articula-se com o quadro estratégico e normativo estabelecido no Programa Nacional da Política de Ordenamento do Território, nos planos regionais de ordenamento do território e nos planos sectoriais relevantes. A REN é uma estrutura biofísica que integra o conjunto das áreas que, pelo valor e sensibilidade ecológicos ou pela exposição e susceptibilidade perante riscos naturais, são objecto de protecção especial, e visa contribuir para a ocupação e o uso sustentáveis do território e tem por objectivos:a) Proteger os recursos naturais água e solo, bem como salvaguardar sistemas e processos biofísicos associados ao litoral e ao ciclo hidrológico terrestre, que asseguram bens e serviços ambientais indispensáveis ao desenvolvimento das actividades humanas;b) Prevenir e reduzir os efeitos da degradação da recarga de aquíferos, dos riscos de inundação marítima, de cheias, de erosão hídrica do solo e de movimentos de massa em vertentes, contribuindo para a adaptação aos efeitos das alterações climáticas e acautelando a sustentabilidade ambiental e a segurança de pessoas e bens;c) Contribuir para a conectividade e a coerência ecológica da Rede Fundamental de Conservação da Natureza;d) Contribuir para a concretização, a nível nacional, das prioridades da Agenda Territorial da União Europeia nos domínios ecológico e da gestão transeuropeia de riscos naturais.Não existe um mecanismo formal específico para uma monitorização sistemática da eficácia destas medidas, sendo a monitorização executada com recurso à verificação da identificação, delimitação e/ou transposição, nos instrumentos de gestão territorial (IGT) da rede fundamental de conservação da natureza (RFCN), composta pelas áreas nucleares de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade integradas no sistema nacional de áreas classificadas e pelas áreas de reserva ecológica nacional, de reserva agrícola nacional e do domínio público hídrico enquanto áreas de continuidade que estabelecem ou salvaguardam a ligação e o intercâmbio entre as diferentes áreas nucleares de conservação, contribuindo para uma adequada protecção dos recursos naturais e para a promoção da continuidade espacial e também pela verificação da adequação das normas de uso e de ocupação do solo e/ou de níveis de protecção estabelecidos, bem como da transposição de normas de gestão específicas para habitats e/ou espécies. Compete às entidades com competências sobre as componentes da Rede Fundamental de Conservação da Natureza pronunciarem-se se os Planos têm em consideração as redes ecológicas: i) Comissões de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional e Comissão Nacional da Reserva Ecológica Nacional no caso da REN, sendo que compete à Comissão Nacional da REN monitorizar a aplicação das orientações estratégicas a nível municipal; ii) Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade no caso da Rede Natura 2000 e áreas protegidas; iii) INAG no caso do Domínio Hídrico, e iv) Direcções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas, no caso da Reserva Agrícola Nacional. Não existe um único relatório abrangente, alvo de elaboração regular, que analise a eficácia da aplicação da legislação quanto à consideração das redes ecológicas no Planeamento Territorial. Todavia, os diversos IGT, de iniciativa municipal ou da administração central, recentemente elaborados ou revistos, identificam indicadores que permitirão aferir da eficácia das medidas tomadas, nomeadamente no âmbito da respectiva avaliação ambiental estratégica (AAE).Os Relatórios de Estado do Ordenamento do Território (REOT) (Decreto-Lei n.º 46/2009) são elaborados de dois em dois anos traduzindo o balanço da execução dos IGT objecto de avaliação, bem como dos níveis de coordenação interna e externa obtidos, fundamentando uma eventual necessidade de revisão do IGT. Pela sua periodicidade, esta aferição comporta em si mesma um elemento de monitorização. Outro exemplo: no caso da REN, a Comissão Nacional da REN elabora, de dois em dois anos, um relatório de avaliação. Como mecanismo de coordenação interministerial funciona a Comissão de Coordenação Interministerial que tem entre uma das suas incumbências a promoção da integração dos princípios de conservação e utilização sustentável da biodiversidade nas diferentes políticas sectoriais (Resolução de Conselho de Ministros n.º 41/99, de 17 de Maio), incluindo-se aqui considerações relativas à rede ecológica no planeamento. Funcionam ainda Comissões de Acompanhamento de planos especiais e de planos municipais de ordenamento do território, compostas por representantes dos diversos sectores da administração directa e indirecta do Estado, que deverão reflectir a natureza dos interesses a salvaguardar.As Comissões de Acompanhamento dos processos de revisão dos Instrumentos de Gestão Territorial, que integram representantes de diversos organismos públicos, são um mecanismo de coordenação interministerial que se debruça sobre a inclusão das considerações da rede ecológica no ordenamento do território.No caso da REN, a CNREN é composta por representantes de diferentes ministérios. Na Região Autónoma dos Açores o mecanismo de coordenação entre departamentos do Governo Regional assenta nas comissões mistas de coordenação e/ou comissões de acompanhamento dos IGT, as quais abrangem a inclusão de considerações da rede ecológica no ordenamento do território. Não se considera que a rede ecológica esteja completa. Se bem que as áreas classificadas estejam estabilizadas e para todo o território e estejam delimitadas a Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN), a Reserva Agrícola Nacional (RAN) e o Domínio Hídrico, entende-se que será necessário apurar a delimitação da REN segundo as novas orientações, integrar os corredores ecológicos definidos nos Planos Regionais de Ordenamento Florestal (PROF) e, eventualmente, considerar outras áreas que se revelem essenciais à conectividade, por exemplo, para determinadas espécies prioritárias.Essa rede de conectividade terá de ser incorporada e estabelecida nos planos especiais e municipais de ordenamento do território, dado que são aqueles que vinculam directamente os utilizadores do solo. ','','Tendo em consideração os contextos de participação e contribuição directa e indirecta das Comissões de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional na concretização das “redes” e “corredores” ecológicos, considera-se de realçar, a título de exemplo,:- Acompanhamento da elaboração e revisão dos IGT (Planos Directores Municipais, Planos de Pormenor, Planos de Urbanização e Planos Especiais de Ordenamento do Território), no qual se acautela sistematicamente a conformidade com os planos sectoriais de ordenamento do território, designadamente o Plano Sectorial da Rede Natura 2000 e os Planos Regionais de Ordenamento Florestal, e a articulação com os Planos Especiais de Ordenamento do Território.- Execução do procedimento de Avaliação Ambiental Estratégica de Planos, permitindo uma integração das questões ambientais no decurso do processo de planeamento, influenciando as opções a tomar.- Elaboração de guias orientadores sobre o Ordenamento das Áreas Classificadas e o Ordenamento dos Espaços Florestais para a revisão dos Planos Directores Municipais.- A elaboração dos Planos Regionais de Ordenamento do Território, designadamente na definição da Estrutura Regional de Protecção e Valorização Ambiental (ERPVA) que integra componentes da Rede Fundamental de Conservação da Natureza, normas orientadoras - regulação dos usos compatíveis com os objectivos de salvaguarda de recursos e funcionamento dos sistemas, indicações para a transposição para os IGT. A ERPVA tem como objectivo garantir a manutenção, a funcionalidade e a sustentabilidade dos sistemas biofísicos (ciclos da água, do carbono, do azoto), assegurando, desta forma, a qualidade e a diversidade das espécies, dos habitats, dos ecossistemas e das paisagens. Contribui assim para o estabelecimento de conexões funcionais e estruturais entre as áreas consideradas nucleares do ponto de vista da conservação dos recursos para, desta forma, contrariar e prevenir os efeitos da fragmentação e artificialização dos sistemas ecológicos e garantir a continuidade dos serviços providenciados pelos mesmos: aprovisionamento (água, alimento), regulação (clima, qualidade do ar), culturais (recreio, educação) e suporte (fotossíntese, formação de solo). Neste sentido, a ERPVA é o garante da existência de uma rede de conectividade entre os ecossistemas, contribuindo para uma maior resiliência dos habitats e das espécies face às previsíveis alterações climáticas, e possibilitando as adaptações necessárias aos sistemas biológicos para o assegurar das suas funções. É constituída por áreas de mais valia ambiental e corredores ecológicos. Nas áreas de mais valia ambiental distinguem-se as áreas classificadas (Rede Nacional de Áreas Protegidas, Rede Natura 2000 e outras derivadas de convenções internacionais), e as que abrangem áreas que possuem valor para a conservação da natureza (biótopos naturais de valor) como sejam as áreas agro-florestais, as Importante Bird Areas e outros sistemas biogeográficos, não classificados. Consideram-se dois tipos de corredores ecológicos: os corredores ecológicos estruturantes, que assentam nas principais linhas de água e na zona costeira; os corredores identificados nos Planos de Ordenamento Florestal que constituem os Corredores Ecológicos Secundários. Estes corredores assumem uma extrema importância, na medida em que salvaguardam a ligação e os intercâmbios genéticos entre diferentes áreas nucleares de conservação, promovendo a continuidade espacial e a conectividade das componentes da biodiversidade em toda a Região A Região Autónoma dos Açores (RAA) adaptou o Regime Jurídico dos Instrumentos de Gestão Territorial (RJIGT) Decreto-Lei n.º 380/99, de 22 de Setembro e respectivas actualizações através do Decreto Legislativo Regional nº 14/2000/A, de 23 de Maio. Este DLR sofreu posteriores revisões constituindo o Decreto Legislativo Regional n.º 43/2008/A, de 8 de Outubro a mais recente. Esta Região está a a preparar um regime jurídico dedicado às áreas afectas à reserva ecológica.Está igualmente em curso um desenvolvimento legislativo, no âmbito do Decreto Legislativo Regional n.º 15/2007/A, de 25 de Junho, que procedeu a uma reformulação do regime jurídico da classificação, gestão e administração das áreas protegidas dos Açores. Classifica e reclassifica as áreas protegidas, assente num modelo de gestão fundamentado em tipologias de classificação e categorias de acordo com os critérios da IUCN, surgindo assim os Parques Naturais de Ilha, nos quais se encontram identificadas as áreas ecologicamente sensíveis. A Região Autónoma da Madeira, aquando do delineamento e criação das suas áreas protegidas, sejam elas o Parque Natural da Madeira (PNM), Reservas Naturais Parciais e Integrais, ou ainda Sítios de Importância Comunitária, procurou que estes englobassem todos os habitats, flora e fauna de importância biológica. Estas áreas protegidas encontram-se desde o litoral (englobando zonas com elevada densidade demográfica) até ao interior das ilhas (onde ocorrem as áreas de floresta Laurissilva e os maciços montanhosos). Os Parques e reservas criados possuem um papel importante na protecção da biodiversidade e dos ecossistemas, garantido a conectividade ecológica, uma vez que os 49.443 ha de área total protegida da RAM permitem o fluxo de fauna e flora através de corredores ecológicos que facilitam a ligação entre o litoral o interior das ilhas, contribuindo igualmente para a preservação de recursos naturais essenciais.','Duarte, Zulmira Ferreira “Instrumentos de Suporte ao Ordenamento do Território e Avaliação Ambiental Estratégica (em elaboração)”, Dezembro 2009, CCDRCProposta de Plano Regional de Ordenamento do Território da Região Centro – Dezembro de 2009, CCDRC.

	('Portugal',4,'A4_4_1','','Portugal não fez a implementação das Linhas Orientadoras sobre Turismo Sustentável da CDB, não existindo disposições legais que obriguem à sua consideração no planeamento do desenvolvimento turístico. Não é por isso produzido qualquer relatório sobre a utilização destas linhas orientadoras.Todavia existem acções que concorrem para objectivos preconizados pelas Linhas Orientadoras, caso do Programa Nacional de Turismo de Natureza e das Cartas de Desporto de Natureza.Turismo de NaturezaA íntima relação existente entre o suporte natural e as actividades turísticas e a importância que em tal relação adquire a noção de “uso sustentável” estão na origem do Programa Nacional de Turismo de Natureza (Resolução de Conselho de Ministros nº 112/98, de 25 de Agosto) que resultou de uma parceria pioneira em Portugal entre as Secretarias de Estado do Ambiente e do Turismo. Este programa integra-se num conjunto de orientações políticas internacionais direccionadas para o desenvolvimento sustentável das Áreas Protegidas visando a recuperação e conservação do património natural e cultural com base na conservação da natureza, desenvolvimento local, qualificação e diversificação da oferta turística.O quadro legal foi entretanto alterado (Portaria n.º 261/2009, de 12 de Março) redefinindo-se a noção de Turismo de Natureza que, das Áreas Protegidas, se alargou às áreas classificadas ou outras com evidente valor natural. Por outro lado, o reconhecimento da actividade turística como Turismo de Natureza passou a estar baseada na implementação e adesão a um conjunto de requisitos e critérios de boas práticas ambientais e na participação em, pelo menos, um projecto de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade.Finalmente, destaque-se a publicação da Portaria n.º 651/2009, de 12 de Junho, que define um Código de Conduta (responsabilidade empresarial e boas práticas ambientais) a adoptar pelas empresas dedicadas ao turismo de natureza que pretendam obter o reconhecimento oficial da sua actividade.Cartas de Desporto de Natureza A partir de 1999 (Dec. Reg. nº 18/99, de 27 de Agosto) a animação ambiental, interpretação ambiental e desporto de natureza nas Áreas Protegidas bem como o processo de licenciamento das iniciativas e projectos de actividades, serviços e instalações de animação ambiental passaram a estar regulamentados. Cada Área Protegida deveria possuir uma Carta de Desporto de Natureza e respectivo regulamento contendo as regras e orientações relativas a cada modalidade desportiva.Recentemente, o Dec-Lei nº 108/2009, de 15 de Maio regulamentou as condições de acesso e de exercício de actividade das empresas de animação turística e dos operadores marítimo-turísticos listando as actividades desportivas permitidas em Áreas Protegidas.Encontram-se publicadas as Cartas de Desporto de Natureza dos:•	Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeiros, em 2004 (com revisão prevista para 2010); •	Parque Natural de Sintra-Cascais e respectivo regulamento Encontram-se em fase final de elaboração as Cartas de Desporto de Natureza de: •	Parque Natural Litoral Norte; •	Parque Natural Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina•	Reserva Natural do Estuário do Tejo•	Reserva Natural das Lagoas de Santo André e da Sancha•	Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado•	Reserva Natural do Sapal de Castro Marim e Vila Real de Santo António•	Paisagem Protegida da Arriba Fóssil da Costa da CaparicaNa Região Autónoma dos Açores o Plano de Ordenamento Turístico (POTRAA) tem como grandes objectivos a diversificação, a melhoria da competitividade, a compatibilização do Plano com as diversas políticas regionais de ocupação do território e o desenvolvimento de produtos turísticos de acordo com as características naturais e humanas das diversas ilha. Estabelece ainda parâmetros para o crescimento do sector, ao mesmo tempo que potencia Vocações Turísticas por ilha e estabelece Espaços Específicos de Vocação Turística.O Governo Regional decidiu relançar a elaboração do Plano Regional de Ordenamento do Território dos Açores (PROTA), em resultado da necessidade de o adequar aos objectivos estratégicos de desenvolvimento da Região e obter um instrumento de desenvolvimento territorial de natureza estratégica, que traduza em termos espaciais, os grandes objectivos de desenvolvimento económico e social sustentável e que equacione as medidas tendentes à atenuação das assimetrias de desenvolvimento intra-regionais, procedendo igualmente a um correcto aproveitamento das aptidões naturais e potencialidades de cada ilha.O Plano de Ordenamento Turístico da Região Autónoma dos Açores (POTRAA), aprovado pelo Decreto Legislativo Regional n.º 38/2008/A, de 11 de Agosto, assumiu na sua elaboração medidas relativas à protecção de reservas naturais, biótopos, zonas de protecção especial, sítios de interesse comunitário, etc. Essas áreas, referidas no POTRAA como \"Espaços ecológicos de maior sensibilidade\" são definidas no respectivo artº 12º como áreas de aptidão muito limitada para a utilização turística e fortes condicionamentos à edificabilidade, pelo que apenas é permitida a instalação de unidades de alojamento nos termos dos regimes de protecção próprios deste espaços.A Região Autónoma da Madeira (RAM), enquanto região turística, sempre teve uma profunda preocupação na promoção de um turismo sustentável com respeito pela riquíssima biodiversidade que o arquipélago encerra.

The establishment of the Fund for the Conservation of Nature and Biodiversity is designed to support nature conservation, particularly in the areas that comprise the RFCN, by allocating resources to projects and investments needed and appropriate management of basic infrastructure needed.It should also be noted that on 11 October 2001, the Resolution of Council of Ministers No. 152/2001 National Strategy for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity (ENCNB) was adopted. The ENCNB is a strategic tool of the utmost relevance at the national level, notably to achieve the commitment by 2010 to stop biodiversity loss.

Ao nível da RNAP, com o objectivo de clarificar e actualizar o regime actual, o presente Decreto-Lei dispõe sobre as categorias e tipologias de áreas protegidas — prevendo no nosso ordenamento jurídico, expressamente, a possibilidade da existência de parques nacionais nas Regiões Autónomas —, os respectivos regimes de gestão e estrutura orgânica e ainda sobre os objectivos e os procedimentos conducentes à sua classificação.Por outro lado, com o objectivo de simplificar e adaptar o regime vigente às características específicas das reservas naturais, das paisagens protegidas e dos monumentos naturais de âmbito nacional, bem como das áreas protegidas de âmbito regional ou local, é introduzida, com carácter inovatório, a ponderação casuística da necessidade de existência de planos de ordenamento para as duas primeiras tipologias — aquando da respectiva classificação — e a dispensa de elaboração de tais instrumentos de gestão territorial no caso dos monumentos naturais e das áreas protegidas de âmbito regional ou local.Quanto às áreas classificadas ao abrigo de compromissos internacionais assumidos pelo Estado Português, destaca -se a criação da figura dos espaços naturais protegidos de carácter transfronteiriço, designados «áreas protegidas transfronteiriças», e a consagração legal das áreas abrangidas por designações de conservação de carácter supranacional.Ao nível da organização da informação, destaca-se a consagração do Sistema de Informação sobre o Património Natural (SIPNAT) e a criação do Cadastro Nacional dos Valores Naturais Classificados. Resumidamente, o SIPNAT é constituído pelo inventário da biodiversidade e dos geossítios presentes no território nacional e nas águas sob jurisdição nacional, enquanto que o Cadastro Nacional dos Valores Naturais Classificados — instrumento mais operacional —, é um arquivo de informação sobre os valores naturais classificados ou considerados sob ameaça pela autoridade nacional.Face aos compromissos assumidos internacionalmente pelo Estado Português, são reforçados os mecanismos que permitam a Portugal cumprir as obrigações assumidas quer no âmbito da União Europeia quer no âmbito da Organização das Nações Unidas — suster a perda de biodiversidade até 2010 e para além —, de acordo com um conceito dinâmico de conservação da biodiversidade, na relação desta última com as alterações climáticas, no combate à desertificação e erradicação da pobreza, no seu papel transversal ao desenvolvimento sustentável, na necessidade de alargar o reconhecimento público da biodiversidade, integrando -a no sistema económico e empresarial, e no reconhecimento de cada cidadão como directa e simultaneamente beneficiário e implicado na gestão da biodiversidade.Na verdade, com uma dimensão e complexidade crescentes nas sociedades modernas, a política de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade enfrenta o desafio de se assumir como um serviço público que garanta a gestão ambiental do território, num quadro de valorização do património natural e de adequado usufruto do espaço e dos recursos. Por outro lado, a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade constitui também um motor de desenvolvimento local e regional, associado à identificação de caracteres próprios e distintivos que urge valorizar, através de uma actividade de gestão e aproveitamento sustentável dos recursos naturais, com o envolvimento e participação de toda a sociedade, numa lógica de benefício comum.Neste contexto, o presente Decreto-Lei define orientações estratégicas e instrumentos próprios, visando os seguintes objectivos essenciais:i) Garantir a conservação dos valores naturais e promover a sua valorização e uso sustentável;ii) Promover a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade como dimensão fundamental do desenvolvimento sustentável, nomeadamente pela integração da política de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade na política de ordenamento do território e nas diferentes políticas sectoriais;iii) Integrar critérios de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade nos sistemas sociais,  empresariais e económicos;iv) Definir e delimitar uma infra -estrutura básica de conservação da natureza, a citada RFCN;v) Contribuir para a prossecução dos objectivos fixados no âmbito da cooperação internacional na área da conservação da natureza, em especial os definidos na Convenção das Nações Unidas sobre a Diversidade Biológica, adoptada no Rio de Janeiro em 5 de Junho de 1992;vi) Promover a investigação científica e o conhecimento sobre o património natural, bem como a monitorização de espécies, habitats, ecossistemas e geossítios;vii) Promover a educação e a formação da sociedade civil em matéria de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade e assegurar a informação, sensibilização e participação do público, incentivando a visitação, a comunicação, o interesse e o contacto dos cidadãos com a natureza;viii) Promover o reconhecimento pela sociedade do valor patrimonial, intergeracional, económico e social da biodiversidade e do património geológico.Especial destaque merece o novo regime económico e financeiro da conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade, que constitui uma componente essencial do presente Decreto-Lei, dada a importância que tal regime reveste para a inversão do ciclo de degradação e desinvestimento na política de conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade verificado nos últimos anos. Assim, a este nível, cumpre assinalar a constituição do Fundo para a Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade, que terá como objectivo apoiar, através da afectação de recursos a projectos e investimentos necessários e adequados, a gestão da infra -estrutura básica de suporte à conservação da natureza, designadamente das áreas que compõem a RFCN.É ainda de referir que a 11 de Outubro de 2001, foi adoptada pela Resolução do Conselho de Ministros nº 152/2001, a Estratégia Nacional de Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade (ENCNB), a qual é uma ferramenta estratégica da maior relevância, a nível nacional, nomeadamente para se alcançar o compromisso de, até 2010, parar a perda da biodiversidade. Esta Estratégia vigora entre 2001 e 2010, estando prevista a sua revisão, no futuro próximo, com base num processo de avaliação e discussão pública.','Regime Jurídico da conservação da natureza - Decreto-Lei n.º 142/2008, de 24 de Julho http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2008/07/14200/0459604611.pdf Estratégia Nacional da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade - Resolução do Conselho de Ministros nº 152/2001, de 11 de Outubro http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2001/10/236B00/64256451.pdf Fundo para a Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade.- Decreto-Lei 171/2009 de 3 de Agosto http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2009/08/14800/0499104993.pdf','22/04/2010','','','07/05/2010',''),

Foi gerada através de um procedimento semi-automático que explora a informação EO Landsat  e o Corine Land Cover como fonte de calibragem da informação. Um estado preliminar é a definição da legenda da ocupação do solo. Tomando em consideração a filosofia do projecto, é necessário definir uma legenda que equilibre os seguintes pontos:•	A legenda deve ser suficientemente detalhada para representar todas as classes de ocupação do solo necessárias para as análises subsequentes;•	A função de processamento do land cover deve ser tão automática quanto possível e requer um input mínimo de informação EO data (i.e. 2 Landsat frames ao ano) e dados de campo de confirmação;•	A precisão temática do mapa final deve estar entre os 80 e 90 %.Da carta da ocupação do solo vários indicadores são avaliados por extracção directa da classe de ocupação do solo:•	Áreas florestais (simplesmente agregando as classes de vegetação de interesse, i.e. Floresta Caduca, Floresta de Coníferas)•	Impermeabilização do solo (igual à classe de Áreas Artificializadas)•	Terras de regadio (igual à classe de Área Irrigada)Outros indicadors são avaliados através de análise espacial específica:•	Fragmentação da Floresta (definida em Hurd et al., 2002): estima a qualidade da floresta numa area que é geralmente coincidente com um limite administrativo, em termos de densidade florestal (quantidade de área florestal sobre a área total) e continuidade (número de mosaicos/pixels adjacentes a um área florestada).•	Áreas Re-naturalizadas: estima a alteração de ocupação do solo de agricultura a classes de vegetação natural e relaciona-a com as alterações demográficas. Onde ocorre uma alteração de agricultura a vegetação natural numa dada area em simultâneo a uma redução da população (estimada por informação auxiliar, como censos), a área sofre uma re-naturalização.Na Região Autónoma dos Açores são também utilizados os seguintes indicadores:•	Estado Trófico das Lagoas (Concentração de Fósforo Total; Média anual da concentração de clorofila; Penetração da Luz)•	Qualidade das massas de água (concentração de CBO5; Fósforo e Azoto).

	('Portugal',15,'C1_3_1','','Não foram ainda desenvolvidos esquemas de monitorização integrada relativamente aos tipos de habitats e espécies da flora e fauna protegidas pelas Directivas Aves e Habitats. A autoridade nacional para a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade (ICNB) encontra-se neste momento a desenvolver uma metodologia-tipo tendo em vista a monitorização integrada dos valores protegidos pelas Directivas Aves e Habitats da Região Norte de Portugal, que será posta em prática, a título experimental, durante o ano de 2010, no sentido de afinar eventuais detalhes de modo a estender a referida metodologia, com as devidas adaptações, a todo o território continental.Têm vindo no entanto a ser monitorizadas regularmente a nível nacional algumas espécies da fauna, com um peso maior sobre o grupo avifaunístico. Os morcegos cavernícolas estão entre as espécies de morcegos mais ameaçadas em Portugal continental. A fragilidade destas espécies torna-as vulneráveis à possibilidade de um rápido declínio que deverá ser identificado e revertido atempadamente. Acompanhar a tendência destas espécies é assim o principal objectivo do Programa de Monitorização dos Abrigos Subterrâneos mais importantes. Este Programa permite, no entanto, também identificar factores que podem condicionar o uso da cavidade subterrânea como abrigo de morcegos (p. ex. obstrução de acessos pela vegetação ou derrocadas, excesso de visitação ou acumulação de lixo).O Programa de Monitorização de Abrigos Subterrâneos foi iniciado formalmente no Verão de 1987, tendo tido continuidade até à data. Consiste na visitação dos abrigos nas épocas mais críticas para os morcegos – hibernação (Janeiro e Fevereiro) e criação (Abril e Maio para Myotis myotis e Junho e Julho para as restantes espécies cavernícolas). Em cada visita é obtida uma estimativa do nº de indivíduos de cada espécie presente no abrigo, seja por contagem directa, estimativa da área da colónia ou, a posteriori, através da análise de fotografias das colónias.Apesar das limitações inerentes a este tipo de monitorização (p. ex. a irregularidade na utilização dos abrigos em anos distintos ou a pouca precisão de algumas das estimativas), o acompanhamento contínuo de um número elevado de abrigos durante um longo período de anos permite já a definição da evolução e tendência das populações de muitas das espécies cavernícolas. Esta informação tem sido fundamental para a definição de estatutos e de estratégias para a conservação destas espécies.A Abetarda (Otis tarda) é uma espécie dependente dos meios agrícolas que devido ao estatuto de conservação desfavorável e elevada vulnerabilidade a alterações do habitat é considerada como uma espécie prioritária em termos de conservação na Europa. Apesar das pseudo-estepes ou estepes cerealíferas constituírem uma das paisagens dominantes do nosso país, é considerado um dos ecossistemas mais ameaçados, devido à rapidez com que o homem os transforma e destrói. Tratando-se de sistemas agrícolas economicamente marginais, verifica-se, por um lado, a intensificação agrícola nos solos mais produtivos e, por outro, o abandono ou a florestação nos menos produtivos. O Programa de Monitorização da Abetarda foi iniciado na primavera de 1980, tendo tido continuidade até à data. Para além da monitorização anual, de cinco em cinco anos são prospectadas as áreas onde há registos anteriores de reprodução mas cujos núcleos entretanto se extinguiram. Este trabalho, tendo como objectivo detectar casos de reocupação, está previsto ser efectuado em 2010. A monitorização consiste na visitação das áreas de parada nupcial na altura em que o maior número de fêmeas está reunida aos machos e antes destas, após a cópula, se dispersarem para os locais de nidificação. Este período, de cerca de quinze dias, pode variar entre a última década de Março e a primeira quinzena de Abril, mediante as condições atmosféricas, nomeadamente temperatura, pluviosidade, vento e luminosidade. As áreas são percorridas em veículo todo-o-terreno de forma sistemática com paragens para observação de forma a cobrir visualmente todo a extensão e evitando duplicação de contagens. Nestas contagens directas é feita a distinção entre machos e fêmeas e ainda registadas as crias macho do ano anterior. O acompanhamento contínuo da área de distribuição da Abetarda em Portugal durante um longo período de anos permite a definição da evolução e tendência da população, tendo sido fundamental para a definição de estatuto e de estratégias para a conservação desta espécie, bem como para a escolha de áreas designadas como Zonas de Protecção Especial.Outro esquema de monitorização, desenvolvido no âmbito do “Memorando de entendimento entre o Ministério do Ambiente e Ordenamento do Território (MAOT) e o Ministério da Agricultura, Pescas e Florestas (MAPF) da República Portuguesa e o Ministério do Meio Ambiente do Reino de Espanha para a cooperação sobre a águia-imperial e o lince”, processo coordenado pelo ICNB e pela Dirección General para la Biodiversidad do Ministério del Medio Ambiente foi muito recentemente desencadeado, incidindo sobre toda a actual área de distribuição de águia-imperial. Efectuam-se anualmente desde 1976 censos de aves aquáticas em Portugal continental. Actualmente as contagens são realizadas no âmbito do Programa Nacional de Monitorização de Aves Aquáticas Invernantes, coordenado pelo ICNB e realizadas regularmente nas zonas húmidas mais importantes para estas espécies, em particular estuários, pauis, açudes e albufeiras. Este programa inclui ainda contagens de Anseriformes e Gruiformes no período entre Outubro e Março de cada ano.Acções de monitorização de passeriformes em Portugal continental são realizadas no âmbito do Projecto de Estações de Esforço Constante (PEEC), que tem como principal objectivo a obtenção de informação que possibilite analisar as alterações verificadas nas populações destas aves, através de um programa de capturas regulares durante a época de reprodução, em locais e habitats específicos. Actualmente encontram-se em funcionamento 17 estações no continente. Esta acção insere-se no projecto à escala europeia EURO-CES “Constant effort ringing in Europe” promovido pela EURING, baseado no método CES (Constant Effort Sites), e tem como objectivo principal monitorizar as populações das espécies de aves mais comuns, fornecendo ainda informação adicional para outros projectos, quer a nível internacional quer nacional, tais como atlas das Aves Nidificantes, actualização do Livro Vermelho dos Vertebrados e gestão da Rede Natura 2000.O Índice de Aves Comuns (IAC) fornece informação sobre as variações populacionais da generalidade das espécies de aves nidificantes em Portugal, indicando a variação da abundância relativamente ao ano inicial do censo, 2004 (este programa é coordenado pela Sociedade Portuguesa para o Estudo das Aves e contribui anualmente para o Esquema Pan-Europeu de Monitorização de Aves Comuns (PECBMS) coordenado pela BirdLife International e pelo European Bird Census Council).Com incidência geográfica variada mas circunscrita a territórios muito localizados, têm vindo a ser monitorizados outros valores da avifauna conforme referido na tabela acima, alguns deles com o envolvimento estreito de diversas entidades. Estes esquemas de monitorização, alguns deles iniciados muito recentemente, abrangem variadas espécies, desde aves marinhas, estepárias, rupícolas e necrófagas a passeriformes florestais e paludícolas.Outros esquemas de monitorização que se encontram actualmente em curso, mas não desenhados de forma a responderem com rigor às necessidades de informação relativa à avaliação do estado de conservação do património natural protegido, virão mais tarde a incluir necessariamente um programa global de monitorização integrada dos valores das Directivas Aves e Habitats.A título de exemplo, identificam-se adiante projectos de monitorização da responsabilidade da autoridade florestal nacional cujos resultados poderão vir a contribuir de uma forma significativa para a avaliação global do estado de conservação dos valores naturais.I – Esquemas de monitorização - Peixes:(i)	Projecto AquariportAo abrigo deste projecto foram desenvolvidos uma rede de monitorização a nível nacional com 320 estações de amostragem e um índice de avaliação de qualidade ecológica com base em mananciais de peixe.

O principla objectivo deste website é disponibilizar ao público toda a informação científica sobre os peixes de água doce de Portugal. A informação apresentada foi mantida inalterada em relação ao conteúdo de cerca de 700 referências bibliográficas (maioritariamente artigos científicos e relatórios técnicos). Informação sobre a biologia de cada espécie de peixe pode ser encontrada sob o campo “Espécies” e pode ser localizada pelo nome científico ou comum. Sob o campo “localidades” podem procurar-se as espécies que ocorrem em determinado curso de água e verificar o seu grau de abundância nessa comunidade, com base na informação publicada. O campo “Referências” dá acesso à referência bibliográfica completa e também à localização (biblioteca) onde pode ser consultada uma cópia em papel. A CPN deve ser citada como: Ribeiro, F., Beldade, R., Dix, M. & Bochechas, J. 2007 Carta Piscícola Nacional, Ed. Direcção Geral dos Recursos Florestais - Fluviatilis, Lda. Electronic publication (version 11/2008).A CPN também inclui informação sobre os progamas da AFN de monitorização de peixes e mostra a distribuição das espécies de peixe no país, incluindo, quando possível, a sua abundância relativa por espécie em cada localidade.Disponível em: http://www.cartapiscicola.org ou http://www.afn.min-agricultura.pt/portal/pesca/carta-piscicola-nacional(iii)	Projecto Ecosurvey O desenvolvimento de eco-survey como um método para a caracterização de populações de peixes em lagos e albufeiras estratificadas monomíticas do centro e sul quentes de Portugal, permitirá um acréscimo significativo na capacidade actual de monitorização de populações de peixes destas massas de águas. Esta monitorização é essencial para a implementação e avaliação de projectos e medidas para melhoria da qualidade ecológica destas massas de águas, em particular no querespeita à protecção das espécies autóctones (barbo-comum e boga-comum), que aí desenvolvem parte do seu ciclo de vida, especialmente quando adultos. Relatório ainda não disponível.O teste, desenvolvimento e avaliação de método hidro-acústico decorre em 3 albufeiras: Montargil Maranhão e Monte Novo, representando albufeiras monomíticas do centro e sul quentes de Portugal, tanto com respeito a estas populações de peixe, como a outras características influentes no desempenho do método hidro-acústico. O teste em curso incluíu echo-sounding vertical e horizontal, de dia e de noite e num corpo estratificado ou não, para além da intersecção da informação hidro-acústica com a caracterização da poluação de peixe obtida através da deposição de redes.IV – Esquemas de monitorização - Invertebrados:Em Portugal ocorria apenas uma espécie europeia, o lagostim-de-patas-brancas, Austropotamobius pallipes. Durante as últimas décadas, deu-se uma acentuada regressão destas populações e presentemente é considerado extinto em Portugal.Vindas de Espanha, duas espécies americanas invadiram os cursos de água de Portugal.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

No information on ammonium phosphorus concentrations in lakes was available.','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA).Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries.

The latter data were well below the weighted average of 0.116 mg P/l for Eastern Europe in 2005. No information on phosphorus concentrations in lakes was available.','','Large quantities of organic matter (microbes and decaying organic waste) can result in reduced chemical and biological quality of river water, impaired biodiversity of aquatic communities, and microbiological contamination that can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA). Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries. In addition, the average national nitrate concentration in one country may be strongly influenced by another country or countries upstream.

This represents a slight decrease (-0.02) since 1999 and overall a decrease of 0.01 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink:  http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx  Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

This represents a decrease of 0.03 since 1999, but an overall increase of 0.09 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','This data is for Spain EEZ, not including Canary Islands.From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.','Reference or title: Mean marine trophic level, from Sea Around Us Project and Convention on Biological Diversity.Weblink: http://www.seaaroundus.org/sponsor/cbd.aspx Pauly (2005): The Marine Trophic Index: a new output of the Sea Around Us website.

Under the Act, it is prohibited to possess, transport, trade in, import or export any species (or specimen/part/propagule thereof) listed in the catalogue, alive or dead. Article 74.2.i of the Act establishes a National Biodiversity and National Heritage Fund which includes the control and eradication of IAS.

	('Sweden',1,'A1_1','','See under Additional clarifications below for the detailed data.Habitats currently enjoying a favourable conservation status are mainly found within the northern mountain range, and in rocky areas all over the country, where levels of exploitation are low, and land use is less intense. This applies to e.g. Baltic islands and islets, alpine grasslands and heaths as well as screes and caves. Other habitats with a favourable conservation status are dystrophic lakes (nationwide) and calcareous fens with Cladium mariscus (Boreal and Continental biogeographical regions). Several other lacustrine, riverine and wetland habitats only reach a favourable conservation status in the Alpine region, where they cover large areas, are widely distributed, and often occur within protected areas. In other parts of Sweden river damming, wetland drainage, sewage effluents and excessive use of fertilisers have caused severely disturbed hydrological conditions and eutrophication. As a result, many habitats are currently in an unfavourable conservation status. In recent years, strengthened legislation regulating all kinds of drainage has, however, contributed to an improvement of the situation.  Marine habitats, forests and grassland habitats are generally heavily affected, and as a result neither range nor structures and functions reach satisfactory levels. Problems are often associated with inappropriate land use and human exploitation of land and water resources. The situation for several marine habitats is regarded as unfavourable, with negative future prospects, due to excessive nutrient levels and commercial fisheries (mainly bottom trawling). Forest habitats are adversely affected by clear-cutting and other forest practices. Modern forestry management results in severe deficits of coarse woody debris and old trees, and natural disturbances such as fire and flooding are scarce. Valuable grassland habitats suffer from lack of management and are consequently becoming increasingly over-grown with young trees and bushes. Abandonment of agricultural land, fertilisation through deposition of air-borne nitrogen, and an ever more intense use of remaining areas constitute major problems. A small but positive exception concerns calcareous grasslands and alvar on the island of Öland, where a LIFE-funded restoration project has been highly successful.In the Alpine biogeographical region, 50% of more of all habitat types are reported to be in a favourable condition. 2 of the 2 (100%) of heath and scrub habitats are in favourable condition.

Note this refers to all bird species of Sweden, while the conservation status for the other taxa refers only to those of Community Interest and are listed in the annexes to the Habitats Directive (see under clarification)! The national Swedish Red List from 2005 gives that out of 251 assessed bird species, 88 species are red-listed and distributed on the Red List categories as follows: RE 8, CR 5, EN 7, VU 31, and NT 37. With regard to non-bird taxa, similar patterns as above under target 1.1 (regarding habitats) apply also to the species. The differences in conservation status between organism groups are, however, large. The conservation status of species and populations is, in general, more favourable in the northern part of the country. This is also true of species associated with montane and rocky habitats. The conservation status of vascular plants and freshwater insects is, on average, better than that of other groups, but also some mammal and fish species maintain a favourable status. Enduring work to decrease acidification, and to restore natural watersheds, together with construction of new ponds and wetlands, is beginning to yield improved conditions for many aquatic organisms. In addition, all frog and toad species currently in an unfavourable conservation status are subjected to Species Action Plans.  Many species are, however, threatened and fail to reach a favourable conservation status. This is often due to decreasing range and excessive loss of habitat, in conjunction with small population sizes. The situation is especially serious for listed butterflies, woodland insects and marine mammals. Commercial fisheries and chemical pollution are major threats to seals and Harbour porpoises. The seals are, however, gradually recovering. Commercial fisheries on Atlantic salmon, Vendace, and River lamprey affect these species adversely, as does the presence of dams and other obstacles to migration. Butterflies and some other insects that thrive in traditionally managed, semi-natural grasslands suffer from the abandonment of traditional agricultural practises as well as the transformation of grasslands into woodland. Several species of bryophytes, amphibians, and molluscs are at risk. Prescribed burning of woodland in central and northern Sweden has, however, improved the situation for several species associated with fire and burnt wood.Of the species in the Alpine biogeographical region, the conservation status of 100% of amphibians and reptiles, 3 of the 4 (75%) fish, 2 of the 8 (25%) invertebrates, 6 of the 10 (60%) mammals and 28 of the 29 (97%) of plants was reported to be favourable. 1 of the 4 (25%) and 5 of the 8 (63%) fish and invertebrates are in an unfavourable-inadequate condition, respectively.

On the request of the Government, the Swedish EPA proposed a national action plan for conservation of genetic variation in flora, fauna and fungi in the wild in 2008. The Swedish Board of Agriculture correspondingly worked out an action plan for long-term sustainable management of genetic resources for domestic animals in 2007. Neither of the action plans have yet been funded.The national Programme for Diversity of Cultivated Plants, POM, aims to insure the long-term survival and sustainable use of cultivated plant resources through e.g. inventory, collection and conservation of cultivated plants. POM has had a yearly budget of € 830,000 since 2004, and a proposal for the continuation of POM during 2010-2015 has been drawn up.In-situ conservation of livestock breeds and races, as well as gene bank activities, is funded through the Rural Development Programme. Support is given to livestock owners all over the country so that the breeds are conserved in their original environment. Support is given for a total of 21 breeds: five breeds of cattle, four breeds of goat, 11 breeds of sheep and one pig breed. 1000 farms have received approx. € 650,000 for 2007 and € 700,000 for 2008. RDP support is also given to gene bank activities conducted by the Swedish Society of Old Native Poultry (totally € 60,000 to 749 gene banks) and the Gotlandic Rabbit Society (€ 9,000 to 110 gene banks). As for crops, grassland/pasture species and their wild relatives are generally conserved in-situ through the protection and management of meadows and pasture land. In-situ conservation of tree species consists of the Swedish Forest Agency\'s clonal archives of presumably autochthonous material of oak, spruce and pine and also one archive for Ulmus glabra. The Swedish Forest Research Institute uses Multiple Population Breeding System (MPBS) as to maintain sufficient levels of genetic variation.      NordGen – the Nordic Genetic Resource Center – is a Nordic organization dedicated to the safeguarding and sustainable use of plants, farm animals and forests. The Nordic countries have been co-operating for more than 30 years on conservation of genetic resources. NordGen was established in January 2008 as a result of a merger between the Nordic Gene Bank, the Nordic Gene Bank Farm Animals and the Nordic Council for Forest Reproductive Material. NordGen is mainly financed by the Nordic Council of Ministers.* Several of the Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives deal with conservation of genetic variation. For example, the objective \"A Rich Diversity of Plant and Animal Life\" states that \"nationwide distribution of animal and plant species within their natural ranges will ensure sufficient genetic variation within and between populations\", and further that \"alien species or genetically modified organisms posing a potential danger to human health or threatening to deplete biological diversity in Sweden will not be introduced\". The Swedish Environmental Quality Objective \"A Varied Agricultural Landscape\" has the interim target \"Plant genetic resources and indigenous breeds\" dealing with development of a national programme for plant genetic resources, as well as long-term conservation of indigenous breeds of domestic animals.**There are about four commonly used native and alien tree species in forestry, and approximately additionally six that are moderately used.

Biodiversity surveys and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are not applied in connection with individual afforestation or deforestation operations. However, regeneration felling on sites larger than half a hectare must be notified to the Swedish Forest Agency at least six weeks in advance. The notification must include information for example on area to be felled, regeneration methods to be used, copy of a forest map, a description of the intended conservation measures, and measures to protect the cultural heritage. Notification must also be given if the land is to be used for purposes other than timber production, i.e. if forest fuel is to be removed, if foreign tree species are planned be used, or in the event of protective ditching. The notification process offers the Forest Agency an opportunity to provide advice, information and also to reassure that the operations are done according to the current guidelines. Permanent or very long term loss of forest cover only occurs as a result of urban settlements, infrastructure (such as roads, railways etc.) and industrial activities. In those cases legal provisions such as EIAs apply to control and mitigate impacts.In Swedish forest policy, production goals and environmental goals are given equal weight. Many landowners have Green Forest management plans that contain details concerning the stands production and environmental values. Four different goal classes are used to describe where timber production dominates or when an environmental goal dominates. The establishment of a Green Management Plan may entail inventories of biodiversity.Strategic Environmental Assessment is needed for measures that may imply more general impact, such as when new methods are developed or forestry legislation or policy is altered. One example is new methods for stump-harvest, where the knowledge of environmental aspects are limited.

RIS comprises the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and the Swedish Forest Soil Inventory (MI). Information from the inventory is used for developing and evaluating environmental and forestry policies. In addition, forestry companies, organizations within the sector, and scientists use the information.Sweden is monitoring the area of semi-natural pastures and mown meadows on a regular basis. This is done on both national and regional level. These habitats constitute about half of Sweden’s HNV-farmland area (450,000 out of approximately 850,000 hectares; see comment to Action 2.1.3). For the rest of the HNV-farmland area there is no ongoing monitoring. In addition to the quantitative aspects, there is also a national monitoring scheme focusing on biodiversity in the most valuable (highest biological values) of Sweden’s semi-natural pastures and mown meadows (approximately 270,000 hectares). The latter monitoring scheme is carried out as a part of the NILS study. Sweden also monitors farmland birds (FBI), another mandatory baseline and impact indicator in the RDP.','','This Measure of Progress indicates progress regarding the mandatory baseline and impact indicators as well as additional programme-specific indicators related to biodiversity, to establish a Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework under Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive.

This represents a decrease of 0.03 since 1999 and an overall decrease of 0.31 since 1984. In the background paper on interpreting the Marine Trophic Index (Pauly and Watson, 2005), it indicates that a multispecies fishery can safely be assumed to be unsustainable if the mean Trophic Level of the species it exploits keep going down.','','From Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially overaggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries.

The Committee’s principal role is to provide advice to Government and interested parties on issues relating to farm animal genetic resources (FAnGR) and to oversee implementation of the UK’s 2006 National Action Plan on FAnGR.

Sources of organic matter are discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Organic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic processes that demand oxygen. This could result in the development of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The transformation of nitrogen to reduced forms under anaerobic conditions in turn leads to increased concentrations of ammonium, which is toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, depending on water temperature, salinity and pH (EEA).Large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication. This causes ecological changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species (reduction in ecological status) and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The environmental quality of surface waters with respect to eutrophication and nutrient concentrations is an objective of several directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Surface Water Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. In future years, phosphorus concentrations in lakes will be highly relevant to work under the Water Framework Directive (EEA). Note: Data above represent averages across a number of stations across a country and sometimes draw on a very different number of samples between countries. In addition, the average national nitrate concentration in one country may be strongly influenced by another country or countries upstream.

ICZM is being delivered through a 20 year strategy. The Strategy ‘An Integrated Coastal Zone Management Strategy for Northern Ireland -2006 – 2026’ was launched in June 2006. The strategy adheres to the ICZM principles and outlines around 50 objectives relating to the three pillars of sustainable development as well as several on integration. In Scotland, the Scottish Government produced ‘Seas the opportunity:  A strategy for the long term sustainability of Scotland’s Coasts and Seas in 2005. This built upon the Scottish Coastal Forum’s strategy for Scotland’s coast and inshore waters and marine elements of the Scottish Biodiversity strategy. The Scottish Ministers introduced the Marine (Scotland) Bill into the Scottish Parliament in April 2009 and it is anticipated that it will complete parliamentary scrutiny early 2010.  The legislation will include provisions which will enable ICZM through Scottish Marine Regions.In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government\'s strategy Making the Most of Wales’ Coast 2007 outlines the values of ICZM including the 8 principles described in the EU recommendation. The Strategy explains how these principles are being put into practice in Wales through promoting and supporting partnership working, including the Wales Coastal &  Maritime Partnership, the Welsh Assembly Government’s key advisory body, and regional coastal forums.  ','','England:Under each Objective of the Strategy were a series of actions and an overview of the relevant work already being taken forward. This included aspects of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill (which became an Act in November 2009), such as the marine planning provisions but the reform and streamlining of the marine consents regime. It also included the Local Democracy, Economic Regeneration and Construction Bill (became an Act in November 2009) which will provide for the integration of regional strategies into a single integrated regional strategy, a combination of the regional planning strategy, regional economic strategy and other regional strategies, and also enables greater participation from the local level in the development of this regional strategy. The Strategy also contains a commitment to work with stakeholders to review the effect of the work, to identify any further actions, and to publish a review two years after publication.Northern Ireland: A key aspect of the implementation of the Strategy was the establishment of a Northern Ireland Coastal and Marine Forum (CMF).  This is an independent, non-statutory body made up of a cross-section of interests ranging from local government, business, agriculture, fishing and environmental bodies.   The Forum aims to provide meaningful stakeholder input into strategic policies affecting the coastal area, as well as raising awareness on Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It also provides expert advice, co-ordinates research, and provides support towards the achievement of the strategy objectives. It is also responsible for monitoring progress and reporting against the strategy objectives and targets. Good progress is being made in implementing the strategy and the CMF first report to Government on progress is due early 2010.Under its remit to promote an understanding of ICZM in Northern Ireland, the Forum has undertaken a number of activities.  They include the development of a website (www.coastalmarineni.org) and production of the following documents for public circulation and an article in NIEA’s magazine, The Coast, describing the approach to ICZM in Northern Ireland.•	A brochure describing the EU principles of ICZM, the Northern Ireland Strategy and the work of the Forum.   •	The second describes the maritime cultural heritage of the Northern Ireland Coast and is designed as a brochure and poster. In addition,.The second area of activity in awareness-raising has been in the organisation of a number of events to promote ICZM.  These included:•	A conference on ‘Planning Challenges and Opportunities for Ireland’s Coast’ was jointly organised with ICONet, the Irish Coastal Network.  This event, attended by over 100 delegates was held in the City Hotel, Londonderry on April 10-11 2008.  The conference, which was opened by the Minister of the Environment, focused on the emerging role of marine spatial planning in the regulation of human activities and interactions. This was examined from European, national and local perspectives. A representative of DG Mare gave a keynote presentation.•	A Conference entitled “The Coast: Are we Managing” was jointly organised with the Strangford Lough Management Advisory Group in November 2008.  It was attended by over 100 delegates, most of whom were directly involved in aspects of coastal management in a local authority or government capacity.•	In addition, the Forum convened a number of workshops on specific themes within ICZM.  These included:•	A workshop on ICZM indicators was held in March 2007 facilitated by Clive Gilbert of the EU expert Group on indicators, and a representative of the European Environment Agency who gave an overview of the recent EEA Report on the State of Europe’s Coastal Environment.  This was attended principally by CMF and NI government representatives. A workshop on marine data collection and storage was organised at Crawfordsburn in Februrary 2009.  This involved NI government departments plus invited speakers from MEDIN and the Channel Coast Observatory.  It was designed to stimulate discussion on coastal data collection, storage and sharing with particular reference to the INPSIRE Directive and other initiatives.  Scotland: The Scottish Ministers launched a consultation on Scotland’s first marine bill ‘Sustainable Seas for All’ in July 2008. The consultation included details on ICZM and regional planning through Scottish Marine Regions.  A majority of the respondents believed that the Scottish Marine Regions should be responsible for ICZM and that it should be guided by the EU eight principles of ICZM.The Bill will introduce legislation to ensure the sustainable management of Scotland’s coasts and seas to balance the competing interests for use and protection of the sea.  There will be a three tier approach to marine planning.  International, EU and national interests will be met through the National Marine Plan while regional marine planning and ICZM will be met through Scottish Marine Regions.  The Scottish Ministers agreed to publish the range of characteristics upon which Scottish Marine Regions will be created.  The Scottish Coastal Forum, carried out a stakeholder workshop in March 2009 to advise Scottish Ministers of the views on how the Scottish Marine Regions should be formed.  Wales: The Welsh Assembly Strategy outlines the issues Wales’ coast faces - from tourism and fisheries to conservation and climate change -and it sets out how ICZM can be used to tackle these. The strategy also explains some objectives that aim towards achieving ICZM ideals focusing on: promoting ICZM at national and local levels; policy integration; integrated planning and decision-taking; better information; promoting awareness of the value of the coastal zone and of ICZM; joining up with our neighbours; and monitoring the ICZM process.Annual progress reports are being produced; the latest is at http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/consmanagement/marinefisheries/iczm/progress/?lang=e Good progress is being made in implementing the strategy, including the work by the Wales Coastal & Maritime Partnership on indicators. The aim of the indicators is to provide a way of consistently reviewing the progress of ICZM across Wales. They will be considered by the Welsh Assembly Government in its review of the strategy scheduled for 2010, which will focus on how IZCM can be integrated with the marine planning functions under The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (UK wide legislation).','England: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/documents/iczm/iczm-strategy-england.pdf; Northern Ireland: http://www.doeni.gov.uk/iczm_document-2.pdf Scotland: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/26102543/25444;Wales: http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/consmanagement/marinefisheries/iczm/welshstrategy/?lang=en','26/02/2010','','','16/03/10',''),

The UK has specific management plans for Salmon and Eel populations, and habitat restoration is undertaken as part of these plans. Removal of migratory barriers is undertaken for eels and is planned for Salmon (May 2011). Stock enhancement is not directly undertaken but is achieved through reducing fishing effort. Salmon Management Plan: Salmon Action Plans (SAPs) are the means by which the Environment Agency (EA) aims to meet the objectives of its National Salmon Management Strategy (launched in 1996) at a local level. The programme of SAPs for the 62 principal salmon rivers in England and Wales was completed in April 2004. The SAPs set specific spawning targets for individual rivers, against which stock and fishery performance are assessed. This has been advocated by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) to facilitate salmon management in the international context.  Each river\'s SAP contains a range of actions to help achieve spawning targets, such as reducing exploitation, improving habitat and water quality and minimising obstructions to migration.Eel Management Plan: Council Regulation (EC) No. 1100/2007 establishes measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel. The UK submitted 15 Eel Management Plans (EMP) to the European Commission, covering the River Basin Districts, as defined under the Water Framework Directive, in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  These plans outline the current situation and how the UK intends to achieve the targets that are required by the EU Regulation. The Eels Order will provide the Environment Agency with the necessary powers to regulate the eel fisheries and improve their passage both up- and down-stream. Measures in the plan will: reduce fishing pressure (through closed seasons); introduce a scheme to trace eel catches; require installation of eel passes and screens; and require fishers to submit data on catches and on the destination of sold stock. The UK’s EMPs have yet to be approved by the European Commission; however clearance is expected in January. Related actions: Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009: The UK will use the Act to give new powers to the Environment Agency to conserve and manage migratory and freshwater fish, including powers to make emergency byelaws to respond to unforeseen threats to fish stocks as well as powers to introduce a new regulatory systems for the movement of live fish where necessary to protect national and local biodiversity. The current fishing licensing regime will also be modernised, through the introduction of an authorisation scheme for some fishing activities. The related powers, penalities and obligations of the Agency will also be modified.EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC: The River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) for England & Wales were approved for publication on the 22nd of December 2009. These RBMPs will ensure that statutory agencies, businesses, public sector bodies and individuals work together to protect the water environment and address significant impacts by co-ordinating all aspects of water management.

Monitoring seabird by-catch: There is no official by-catch monitoring programme, however data is collected in relation to seabird by-catch.  Since 2003, as part of its data collection in relation to discards (600 observer days per year) CEFAS has collected data on observed seabird by-catch.  This data is presently logged but not externally published.   For UK vessels mitigation measures are in place to prevent the by catch of seabirds by long line vessels fishing in certain areas of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. UK is working within the Management organisations responsible for these oceans to strengthen the measures both in terms of the mitigation devices that should be used and to broaden the sea areas to which they are applicable.The UK is aware that a lack of data at the EU level in relation to the extent and location of seabird by-catch remains a problem and is fully supportive of the need to improve this.  The UK will push for data collection to be a key part of the EU Seabird by-catch Plan of Action. The UK supports fully the need for an EU Seabird By-catch Plan of Action and has strongly encouraged the EU Commission to bring this forward as soon as possible in 2010.   The UK feels strongly that a plan of action is needed urgently so that there can be proper discussion and consultation throughout the community.

However, there are different ways of defining marine sites and methods used by the UK suggest there are 154 European Marine sites with marine components consisting of: 76 inshore SACs and 78 inshore SPAs. The UK also has 5 offshore Sites of Community Interest and is working to designate additional sites over the next two years to complete the Natura 2000 network. Outside of territorial waters, the Darwin Mounds (in the north west of Scotland) are sites where there have been specific fisheries measures put in place to provide protection from the effects of trawling of deep-water coral reefs. In 2003 and 2004 the Commission adopted under emergency procedures two Commission Regulations (EC) 1475/2003 and (EC) 263/2004. In 2004 these measures were made permanent (Council Regulation (EC 602/2004)). Within territorial waters, a number of marine natura 2000 sites have had fisheries management introduced.  Types of management measures are listed below. There are also fisheries management measures which have been undertaken, for which the primary purpose was fisheries management, but may have had positive implications for biodiversity. However further analysis would be required in order to give details of these. Several and Regulating Orders.Several and Regulating Orders are granted by Defra which restrict access to/by the owner/s of the Order rather than open access to all fishermen. Because Orders are regarded as subject to the provisions of the Habitats Directive, an appropriate impact assessment is carried out (where necessary) before an Order is granted. As a result fisheries management measures has been modified within some Orders to avoid adverse impacts on marine 2000 sites. Examples of marine natura 2000 sites which overlap with Several and/or Regulating Orders include: Solent Maritime SAC, Solent and Southampton Water SPA, Essex Estuaries SAC, the Wash and North Norfolk SAC, the Wash SPA, Foulness, Benfleet and Southend Marshes SPA and the Thames Estuary Marshes SPA. Within these sites measures have included: i) Total Allowable Catch (TAC) which does not reduce populations below a level from which they can provide sufficient food for SPA birds; ii) limitations on the numbers, location and frequency of boats fishing to prevent damage to sensitive habitat features; and iii) limitations on the type, location and size of fishing gear used to avoid adverse impacts on SAC habitats and site features. Other licence applicationsApplications for licences required for some fishing activities, for example, those under the Coast Protection Act (CPA) or Food and Environmental Protection Act (FEPA) – required for the use of infrastructure in shellfish culture – are also subject to the provisions of the Habitats Regulations. For a licence to be granted, it must be demonstrated that the proposal will not cause an adverse effect to marine natura 2000 site features. SFC byelawSea Fisheries Committees have powers to implement byelaws for the conservation and management of local stocks and have some limited powers to implement byelaws to protect features of conservation interest. These powers will be increased by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 when SFCs are replaced with Inshore Fishery and Conservation Authorities in Aril 2011. Examples are provided below: Flamborough Head SAC is designated for several features including reefs and sea caves. In 2007, it was identified that 70-90% of the site was subject to some degree of trawling activity. In order to prevent damage to the reef a new byelaw was introduced in 2008 to manage trawling activity; establishing a non-trawl zone; introducing a special permit scheme limiting the number of licences available to trawl within the SAC; issuing licenses based on the demonstration of a track record; and the prohibition of beam trawling and multi-rig trawling.   Longer-term plans to monitor the condition of the site are currently being developed.Ministerial OrdersThe Fal and Helford candidate Special Area of Conservation (SAC) was identified in 1996 under the Habitats Directive and has subsequently been designated for a number of priority habitats and features.  The features include sandbanks and maerl bed communities.  Beds of maerl, (the collective name for several species of calcified red seaweed) are of particular value because of the diversity of species they support. Historically, fishing activity in the Fal & Helford Bay had been low, but in 2006 significant increase in scallop dredging in the Bay led to calls for greater protection of the SAC.  Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee with the help of the local fishing community developed a Voluntary Agreement, which provided a degree of protection to the SAC throughout 2007 and 2008 through limited scallop dredging activity in the months of November and December only. However, to afford permanent protection to the SAC, the UK put in place a Statutory Instrument (SI) to prohibit dredging for shellfish and demersal trawling in the outer part of the Fal and Helford SAC.  The Order came in force on 1st October 2008.  To assess the impacts and consequences of the proposed SI, Defra carried out a six-week public consultation from 7 March to 18 April 2008.  The Order is currently being enforced by British sea-fishery officers but no monitoring has been undertaken to assess the extent to which the prohibition has been beneficial to the scallop stocks and marine habitats and features within the SAC. The Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation & Special Protection Area was designated in October 1996. A byelaw was introduced to protect the site by Cumbria SFC (Byelaw 18) which temporarily bans the taking of shellfish. Lundy Special Area of Conservation was designated in January 1996. Devon SFC introduced byelaws to protect the site which includes a ‘No Take Zone’ and the prohibition of trawling and netting. Flamborough Head Special Area of Conservation was designated in January 1996. North Eastern SFC is introducing byelaws to protect the site which will be implemented within the next 6 months. The Humber Estuary candidate Special Area of Conservation & Special Protection Area, were designated in August 2007. North Eastern SFC introduced XXIV Humber Estuary Cockle Fishery Byelaw to protect the site.Coquet Island Special Protection Area was designated July 1995.

Under Module V: Module of evaluation of the effects of the fishing sector on the marine ecosystem, the UK will collect data for ecosystem indicators listed in Appendix XIII of Commission Decision of 6 November 2008 Adopting a multiannual community programme pursuant to council regulation (EC) no 199/2008. For ecosystem indicators 1-4, the UK will use IBTS coordinated trawl surveys in the North Sea and North East Atlantic to collect the required data to support development of these indicators. Additional data will be collected on coordinated beam trawl surveys. For ecosystem indicators 5 – 7, VMS speed and position data for fishing vessels with LOA in excess of the 15m statutory minimum are currently logged by the UK authorities using a 2-h transmission interval. Spatial resolution is better than the 2n.mile grid cell specified by the DCR. Algorithms for filtering data to include only positions during fishing, and to link individual records to the UK Fleet Activity Database to identify fishing gear and other métier-related variables are currently under continuous development within the UK.  CEFAS and FRS have completed their separate development of algorithms linking VMS data to log-book records for all vessels > 15m, and have moved towards implementation.                         Further development will entail efficiency improvements and harmonisation of methods rather than additions to functionality. In view of Lot 2 - Development of tools for logbook and VMS data analysis (Studies for carrying out the common fisheries policy - Open call for tenders No MARE/2008/10), this subsequent development will take place within the international context of that contract, and report with respect to its agreed timelines.  For ecosystem indicator 8 the UK at-sea observer programmes carried out by AFBI, FRS and CEFAS will provide estimates of discarding rates of commercially exploited species by fleet métier.   By-catches of seabirds, reptiles and marine mammals are recorded during these trips.   For ecosystem indicator 9 fuels costs will come from the economic survey. This will be related to the information on fishing activity of the vessel during the corresponding period of economic activity, taking into account period of non-fishing related time at sea (e.g. time spent on pipeline guard duty, support for oil and gas rig operations, etc.) to allow fuel consumption and fishing activity to be directly compared.  Account will be taken of the differing levels of fuel intensity in cases where vessels report using more than one type of fishing gear to ensure adequate accuracy in the estimation of this indicator at the métier level In addition to the indicators above, the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has funded a 5-year research programme at CEFAS (2007 - 2012; Project code MF-10-1) to develop and pilot an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), supported by indicators and management tools. Specifically, it will involve (i) the development, testing and reporting of indicators that allow managers and stakeholders to assess the status of the ecosystem and the impacts of fishing, and (ii) the development of decision tables that allow managers and stakeholders to see the effects of different management options and to choose among them. The form of indicators required by the DCR will be investigated in the project. The project will focus on the development of a pilot application of the EAF in the southwest of England.  The project will establish the links between these indicators of ecological state and indicators of fishing pressure (effort and mortality), as measured for the main fisheries in the southwest and taking account of environmental variation and change. From knowledge of the links, the project will determine the management actions needed to achieve the desired values of indicators and hence the desired state of vulnerable species, vulnerable habitats, and the fish community. This information will be used to develop decision tables that allow managers and stakeholders to see the consequences of different management options for the fishery, target species, and other parts of the ecosystem. Although some DCR time is included by the UK in Financial Tables C to deal with specific requests for data and analysis, it is expected that considerable additional development of the ecosystem indicator approach will take place within the Defra contract MF10-1.','','Appendix XIII of Commission Decision of 6 November 2008 Adopting a multiannual community programme pursuant to council regulation (EC) no 199/2008 Establishing a community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy defines environmental indicators to measure the effects of fisheries on the marine ecosystem.

','','Not including OTsFrom Pauly (2005):Trophic levels (TL) express the position of an animal in a food web, relative to the primary producers (which have a definitional TL of 1). TL can be calculated from:TLi = j TLj × DCij where TLj represents the fractional trophic levels of prey j, and DCij represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. Using catch data, and TL estimates for species (or groups thereof ), mean TL and, hence, Marine Trophic index values, can be computed, for each year k from:Mean TLk = i (Yik x TLi) / i Yik where Yi refers to the landings of species (group) i, as included in fisheries statistics. [Note that, ideally, mean TL should be based on catches - i.e., all animals killed by fishing (landings + discards) – rather than only on the landings included in most fisheries statistics. This is ignored here, where we deal only with landings]. Mean maximum length (ML) is calculated similarly to mean TL, by weighting by the catches.The fishing-in-balance (FiB) index is defined as:FiBk = log[Yk x (1/TE)TLk] – log[Y0 x (1/TE)TL0]where all parameters and subscripts are defined previously, except TE, the mean transfer efficiency (specific to an ecosystem, often set at 0.1), and 0, which refers to any year used as a baseline to normalize the index. This definition implies that the FiB index:Does not change (remains = 0) if TL changes are matched by ‘ecologically correct’ changes in catch;Increases (>0) if: either ‘bottom up effect occurs, e.g., increase in primary production, or if geographic expansion of the fishery occurs (and the ‘system’ definition has in fact changed);Decreases (<0) if the fisheries withdraws so much biomass from the ecosystem that its functioning is impaired.Experience indicates that the MTI is very sensitive to fisheries catches being accurate, and particularly not being taxonomically and spatially over aggregated. Thus, the Sea Around Us project team are working on disaggregating the catch statistics for many countries. Until this is completed for all countries for which this is necessary, it cannot guaranteed that the catch database of the Sea Around Us, mapped by countries’ EEZ, LME and High Sea areas, will allow accurate MTI trends to be computed. Trends of MTI and related indices are thus offered mainly for indicative purpose, and must always be interpreted with caution, especially when the underlying catch statistics are unreliable.The UK also indicate that the UK has not adopted the Marine Trophic Index at UK level. We have a long history of fisheries research, providing us with more robust data to calculate changes in the seas around the UK. After wide consultation with the scientific community we have adopted an alternative indicator on Marine Ecosystem Integrity.

This information is being employed to target action to improve connectivity within, for example, the new agri-environment scheme, Glastir. They are also being used to help develop a strategic ‘green infrastructure’ within the Wales Spatial Plan; a number of pilot projects in southeast Wales are taking these ideas forward. ICCW are also undertaking an assessment of climate change vulnerability of terrestrial sites within the European and national site networks. This assessment has been based on a qualitative assessment for habitat and species features combined with consideration of site condition, identified management issues, habitat connectivity and an evaluation of the size and vulnerability of the soil carbon store within the sites in Wales. The outputs from this work will be used to inform selection of sites that should be a priority for adaptation actions. It will also provide a resource for local staff to inform management decisions. CCW has also used the UKCIP02 climate change projections data to assess the vulnerability of key coastal SACs, such as Bosherston Lakes and Dyfi Estuary,  to sea-level rise in separate projects.

This found that the total amount spent on Biodiversity Research by UK public bodies in 2004/05 was £33 million, out of a total expenditure on environmental research of £284 million.The expenditure was calculated by entering all publically-funded research projects into a central database and assigning a primary purpose to each project. Therefore, £33 million was the expenditure on publically-funded research projects which had biodiversity as their sole or primary purpose.  The amount for 2006 is given as approximately £33 million on the assumption that it would have been similar to the amount found in 04/05.

This was followed by a good practice guide to support the policy statement; including practical examples of how local authorities can plan for biodiversity. In Wales, standardised guidance on the development of local wildlife site systems has been completed.  The guidelines can be applied to a site for evaluation by various criteria including rarity, size, naturalness/typicalness and diversity as well as position in ecological unit, potential value, fragility and educational/social value.

It also stated that it would give advice on nature conservation in the UK\'s overseas territories, focusing on priorities identified by the inter-departmental ministerial group of biodiversity and that it would develop and implement environment-related EU policies and legislation.    The CEH stated that it was committed to conducting research and long-term, large-scale monitoring to develop improved understanding of the biological processes and interactions underlying large-scale biodiversity changes. They proposed the undertaking of integrated assessments of the impact of the land-use change, including habitat degradation, on the reproductive success and dispersal of native and invasive populations to develop better conservation strategies. They also suggested the use of advanced DNA and molecular approaches to quantify the role of genetic diversity to explain how different functional types of organism respond to environmental change. By combining their data through robust statistical analysis and modelling, their aim was to will improve knowledge of how natural resource use affects biodiversity and ecosystem function. They proposed the development of reliable indicators for assessing environmental status across physical and biological scales. Overall their goal was to provide knowledge and science-based advice to support the implementation of policies including Environment Stewardship Schemes, Biodiversity Action Plans and EU Directives.From 2006 to 2008 DEFRA committed £3.8 million to a fund administered by Natural England which supported projects run by voluntary organisations that were contributing towards halting biodiversity loss in England.
